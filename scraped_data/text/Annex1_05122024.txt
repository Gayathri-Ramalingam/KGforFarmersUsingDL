The International

organized by the

standards for labor 
statistics. The ICLS focuses 
on areas such as 
employment, 
unemployment, wages, 
working conditions, and the 
informal economy. The 
standards set by the ICLS 
ensure that labor statistics 
are harmonized and 
comparable across 
countries, supporting 
effective labor market 
policies and research. 
The International Standard 
Classification of 
Occupations (ISCO) is a 
system developed by the 
International Labour 
Organization (ILO) to 
categorize and classify jobs 
and occupations globally. 
ISCO provides a 
standardized framework for 
organizing jobs into groups

based on the tasks and

classification facilitates 
international comparability 
of occupational data, 
supports labor market 
analysis, and aids in the 
development of 
employment policies and

version is ISCO-08. 

The International 
Classification of Status in 
Employment (ICSE) plays a 
crucial role in labour 
statistics, serving as a 
cornerstone for generating 
data that sheds light on the 
composition of the 
workforce based on their 
status in employment

The world's education 
systems vary widely in 
terms of structure and 
curricular content. 
Consequently, it can be 
difficult to compare 
national education systems 
with those of other 
countries or to benchmark 
progress towards national 
and international goals.  
The International Standard 
Classification of Education 
(ISCED 2011) provides a 
comprehensive framework 
for organizing education 
programmes and 
qualification by applying 
uniform and internationally 
agreed definitions to 
facilitate comparisons of 
education systems across 
countries. ISCED is a

organizations. ISCED 2011 
is the second major revision 
of this classification 
(initially developed in the 
1970s and revised in 1997). 
It was adopted by the 
UNESCO General

ICCS is applicable to all 
forms of crime data,

development, urban 
planning, and social 
research related to housing 
affordability, tenure 
security, and housing 
market dynamics. 
The Classification of 
Housing Units by Toilet 
Facilities categorizes 
residential dwellings based 
on the type and availability 
of toilet facilities they 
possess. This classification 

helps in assessing sanitation

policy-making related to 
housing infrastructure and 
sanitation services. 
The Classification of 
Housing Units by Water

The Generic Statistical

(GSBPM) is a standardized 
framework developed by 
the international statistical 
community to depict the 
sequence and stages 
involved in producing 
statistical data. It outlines 
the key processes and 
activities from data

including steps such as data 
validation, processing, 
analysis, and reporting. The 
GSBPM helps statistical 
organizations improve their 
efficiency, consistency, and 
quality of statistical outputs 
by providing a common 
reference model for 
designing, implementing, 
and evaluating statistical 
operations and systems. It

of homogeneous categories 
of goods and services, 
which are considered a

expenditure, which are 
those expenditures that are 
made for the benefit of 
individual persons or 
households. 

Statistical areas such as: 
household expenditure 
statistics based on 
household, budget 
surveys and the analysis 
of living standards; 
consumer price indices 
(for which it is used to 
establish weights and 
aggregate prices); 
international comparisons 
of gross domestic product 
(GDP) and its component

macroeconomic statistical

The Harmonized 
commodity description and

purpose international 
product nomenclature 
developed by the World 
Customs Organization 
(WCO). It is often simply 
called Harmonized 
System and abbreviated 
as HS. 
The HS 2007 is made up of 
about 5,000 commodity 
groups defined at a six-digit 
level (with an additional 
two digits if eight-digit sub-
divisions are required), in a 
legal and logical structure 

Governments, 
International 
organizations and the 
private sector for many 
purposes such as internal 
taxes, trade policies, 
monitoring of controlled 
goods, rules of origin, 
freight tariffs, transport

monitoring, quota 
controls, compilation of 
national accounts, and 
economic research and

More than 200 countries

Distributive trade data. 
Compilations of both 
structural and short-term 
statistics, produce 
monthly or quarterly 
indicators, and often take 
the form of indices. 

Distributive trade statistics 
(DTS) constitute a subject 
area of economic statistics 
concerned with provision of 
data on economic units 
whose main activity is 
wholesaling and retailing 
(that is to say, sale without 
transformation) of any types 
of goods together with 
performing services 
incidental to sales such as 
repair, installation and 
delivery. The growing 
interest in distributive trade 
statistics has been due to a 
steady increase in the 
contribution of distributive 
trade to the total economy 
in terms of value added and 
employment in most 
countries.
