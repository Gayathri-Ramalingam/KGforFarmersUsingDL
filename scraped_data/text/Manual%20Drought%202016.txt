1.1  whAt is drought ? 

Drought is a temporary aberration, unlike aridity or even seasonal aridity (in terms of a well-
defined dry season), which is a permanent feature of climate. Drought in contrast is a recurrent, yet 
sporadic feature of climate, known to occur under all climatic regimes and is usually characterized 
by variability in terms of its spatial expanse, intensity and duration. Conditions of drought appear 
primarily, though not solely, on account of substantial rainfall deviation from the normal and / or 
the skewed nature of the spatial / temporal distribution to a degree that inflicts an adverse impact 
on  crops  over  an  agricultural  season  or  successive  seasons.  What  is  universally  accepted  is  that 
drought stems from a deficiency or erratic distribution in rainfall but the spread and intensity of the 
calamity is contingent on several factors, including the status of surface and ground water resources, 
agro-climatic  features,  cropping  choices  and  patterns,  socio-economic  vulnerabilities  of  the  local 
population etc.  It is difficult to provide a precise and universally accepted definition of drought due 
to its complex nature and varying characteristics that manifest across different agro-climatic regions 
of the world in a myriad different ways.  

Drought  differs  from  other  natural  hazards  such  as  cyclones,  floods,  earthquakes,  volcanic 

eruptions, and tsunamis in that:

There  is  no  universally  accepted  definition  that  can  encapsulate  the  complexity  of  this 
phenomenon   adequately;
It  is  difficult  to  determine  the  beginning  and  end  of  a  drought  episode  because of the slow, 
‘creepy’  onset,  silent  spread  and  gradual  withdrawal.  In  India,  it  is  generally  considered  to  be 
coterminous with the monsoons;
An episode could spill over months or even years with or without any accompanying shift 
in the geographical arena; 
There is no indicator or index which can precisely forecast the advent and severity of a drought 
event, nor project its possible impacts;
Spatial expanse tends to be far greater than in the case of other natural calamities, which when 
compounded  by  the  difficulties  associated  with  the  impact  assessment  of  the  disaster,  makes 
effective response highly challenging;
Impacts are generally non-structural and difficult to quantify e.g. the damage to the ecology, the 
disruption of socio-economic fabric of communities, the long term effects of mal-nutrition on 
health and morbidity etc.;
The impact tends to get magnified in the event of successive droughts.

1.2    drought in indiA

Droughts  during  the  colonial  period,  tended  to  degenerate  into  severe  famines  causing 
massive human losses. According to one estimate, in the latter half of the 19th century, there were 
approximately  25  major  famines  across  India,  which  killed  30-40  million  people. The  first  Bengal 
famine  of  1770  is  estimated  to  have  wiped  out  nearly  one  third  of  the  population. The  famines 
continued until Independence in 1947, with the Bengal famine of 1943–44 which affected 3-4 million 
people, being among the most devastating.

The  situation  improved  remarkably  in  post-independent  India.  Investment  in  irrigation 
works, promotion and availability of quality inputs, focus on research & extension led to increased 
agricultural productivity and greater resilience among the farming communities. This development 
did not only render the country self-sufficient in food production but to a considerable extent, famine 
proof.  Though population quadrupled since Independence, the country did not witness a famine in 
the past 69 years and in fact, India has become a major exporter of agricultural produce in the world. 

With the liberalization of the Indian economy in the 1990s, accelerated growth in industry and 
services saw the share of agriculture in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrink to less than 15% (half 
its share from a few decades ago), yet the country continued to be largely self-sufficient in food and 
agri-commodities, gained greater resiliences in absorbing the impact of drought. 

The history of meteorological drought in India is given in Box 1.

Box 1: Meteorological History of Droughts in India

During 1871–2015, there were 25 major drought years, defined as years with All India Summer 
Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) less than one standard deviation below the mean (i.e. anomaly below 
–10 percent): 1873, 1877, 1899, 1901, 1904, 1905, 1911, 1918, 1920, 1941, 1951, 1965, 1966, 1968, 
1972, 1974, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, 2002, 2009, 2014 and 2015. The frequency of drought 
has varied over the decades. From 1899 to 1920, there were seven drought years. The incidence 
of drought came down between 1941 and 1965 when the country witnessed just three drought 
years. However, during the 21 years, between 1965 and 1987, there were 10 drought years which 
was attributed to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

Among the many drought events since Independence, the one in 1987 was one of the worst, 
with an overall rainfall deficiency of 19% which affected 59–60% of the normal cropped area 
and a population of 285 million. This was repeated in 2002 when the overall rainfall deficiency 
for  the  country  as  a  whole  was  19%.  Over  300  million  people  spread  over  18  States  were 
affected  by  drought  along  with  around  150  million  cattle.  Food  grains  production  registered 
an  unprecedented  steep  fall  of  29  million  tonnes.  In  2009,  the  overall  rainfall  deficiency  for 
the  country  as  a  whole  was  22%,  which  resulted  in  decrease  of  food  grain  production  by  16 
million tonnes. During 2014-15 and 2015-16 large parts of the country were affected by drought 
causing widespread hardships to the affected population since the calamity encompassed major 
agricultural States in the country.

1.2.1  Characteristics of Drought

The occurrence of drought is contingent on a number of factors such as cropping choices and 
agronomic practices, soil types, drainage and ground water profiles, to name a few. However, rainfall 
deficiency and spatial and temporal distribution, duration and dry spells are acknowledged as the 
most important triggers for drought. 

1.2.1.1  Seasonal Characteristics and Intra-Seasonal Variability

India receives most of its rainfall (73%) from the South-West or “summer” Monsoon i.e., (the rainfall 
received between June and September). The summer monsoon sets in during the first week of June 
in the south-west corner of India and gradually proceeds towards the north-west region covering 
the entire country by the second week of July. The withdrawal of the Monsoon commences in the 
first week of September from the west and north and recedes from most parts of the country by the 
month-end.  Even when the overall rainfall in the country was normal, large variations were noticed 
across regions, within States, and sometimes, even within districts. IMD set up 36 meteorological 
sub-divisions straddling over the territories of a dozen districts on an average, in each of the sub-
divisions. Rainfall is categorised as excess, normal, deficient or scanty and the possibility of drought 
arises in the event of deficient or scanty rainfall. 

This pattern of onset (Map 1.1) and withdrawal (Map 1.2) ensures that the duration of the rainy 
season in the north-west region of the country is less than a month on account of the late arrival and 
early cessation of monsoon activities. Conversely, Kerala and north-eastern parts of India receive more 
than 4 months of rainfall due to the wide window afforded by the early arrival and late withdrawal of 
the monsoons.

Coastal areas of peninsular India and Tamil Nadu, in particular, receive bulk of its annual rainfall 
from October to December, from the receding monsoon and periodic cyclonic disturbances in the 
Bay of Bengal, but primarily on account of the North-East monsoons. The broad seasonal distribution 
of rainfall in India is presented in Table 1.1.

The Table 1.2 below throws light on the spatial and temporal extent of rainfall deficiencies in the 
South West Monsoon season recorded across meteorological subdivisions in the country during the 
drought years. It would appear that the geographical spread of the drought over meteorological sub-
divisions was the maximum in 1987 and 2002 among the drought events in the recent past (Table 
1.2). The drought in 2015 too had a very wide coverage, and the impact substantially magnified, by 
the pervasiveness of the ill effects of a major drought during the immediately preceding year.

Table 1.3 provides a comparison of the extent of departure of rainfall from the normal during 
the recent major droughts in 1972, 1979, 1987, 2002, 2014, 2015. Rainfall variation in 2009 appears 
to be higher compared to other drought years at an all India level. The South West Monsoon Season 
in 2009 opened in June with an ominous rainfall deficiency of 47%, which was further aggravated by 
continuing shortfalls in the remaining months. Earlier, during the drought years of 1972, 1979 and 
1987 too, a similar pattern was noticed when each of the four months between June and September 
recorded  deficient  rainfall  at  an  all  India  level.  In  2014,  the  first  three  months  of  the  South West 
Monsoon were characterized by deficient rainfall to an extent that the late season rally in September 
was not sufficient to revive agriculture in most parts of the country.  In contrast, the 2015 season 
started  with  normal  rainfall,  prompting  farmers  to  undertake  large  scale  agricultural  operations, 
before the situation turned progressively adverse into a serious drought in the remaining 3 months, 
causing serious damage to agriculture and losses to the farmers.

1.2.2  Successive Droughts
1.2.2.1  Causes of Recurring Drought in India

A deficiency in rainfall causes depletion of soil moisture, fall in  surface and ground water levels 
which  in  turn  is  likely  to  have  a  deleterious  effect  on  agricultural  operations,  due  to  insufficient 
availability of water for the crops, especially during the critical stages of plant growth. The correlation 
between quantum of rainfall and the trigger for drought in India vary across agro-climatic zones. In 
the semi-arid regions, even a well distributed 400 mm rainfall during a crop season could be adequate 
for the sustenance of crops, while in high rainfall regions like Assam, an annual rainfall of 1,000 mm 
could still create a potential for drought like development. Though deficient rainfall is considered to 
be the primary instigating factor for drought, yet the occurrence, spread and intensity is determined 
by  several  factors  including  susceptibilities  introduced  by  climate  change,  hydrological  and  soil 
profiles, availability of soil moisture, choice of crops and agricultural practices, availability of fodder,  
socio-economic vulnerabilities etc.

The  recurrence  of  drought  in  India  is  owed  largely  to  the  unique  physical  and  climatic 

susceptibilities of the country, which include:

 y

 y

Considerable annual / seasonal/regional variations in spite of a high average annual rainfall of 
around 1,150 mm. The mean annual rainfall across the country is shown in Map. 1.4;
A relatively short window of less than 100 days during the South-West Monsoon season (June to 
September) when about 73% of the total annual rainfall of the country is received. The normal 
rainfall in various parts of the country is shown in Map 1.3;

 y Uneven  distribution  of  rainfall  over  different  parts  of  the  country  in  that  some  parts  bear  an 
inordinately high risk of shortfalls, while others tend to receive excessive rainfall.  Even though 
India receives abundant rain on an average, for the country as a whole, much of the excess water, 
which otherwise could have contributed towards enhancing natural resilience towards drought, 
gets lost as run-offs. The variability in rainfall exceeds 30% in large areas of the country when 
compared to Long Period Average (LPA) and exceeds 50% in parts of drought- prone Saurashtra, 
Kutch and Rajasthan;
Low average annual rainfall of 750 mm over 33% of the cropped area in the country heightens 
the susceptibility to drought;

 y

 y Over-exploitation  of  ground  water  and  sub-optimum  conservation  and  storage  capacity  of 
surface water leading to inadequate water availability for irrigation, particularly in the years of 
rainfall deficiency. Steady decline in per capita water availability for humans and animals even in 
non-drought years;

 y Out  migration  of  cattle  and  other  animals  from  drought  hit  areas  heightens  the  pressure  on 

 y

resources in surrounding regions.
Limited irrigation coverage (net irrigated area in the country is less than 50%) exacerbates the 
impact of drought on account of complete dependence of agriculture in such areas on rainfall 
(Map 1.6).

1.2.2.2  The Senario

Poor rainfall in successive years tend to compound the adverse effect of drought by reducing 
scope for the recharge of surface and ground water resources, replenishment of soil moisture and 
recovery of financial capacity of agriculturists to make investments in agricultural operations. Table 
1.4 shows the extent of departure of rainfall in the Kharif season during successive drought years.

It is evident from Table 1.4 that at the macro-level, the serious droughts in 1966, 1987, 2002 
and 2015 were a culmination of the build up of adverse rainfall events of the preceding years. It is 
worth noting that in several instances, the low rainfall spells have continued over several years e.g. 
1985-87 and 1999-2002 periods. The map 1.5 in Chapter 1 provides a pictographic representation of 
the frequency of drought occurrences in districts between 2000-2015.  The frequencies are derived 
from the number of occasions when droughts were declared in such districts by State Governments 
during the 15-year period. It is hoped that the map will help provide guidance to policy makers in 
identifying areas that are most susceptible to drought for the establishment of monitoring and early 
warning systems. In addition, the map will help focus attention of the Central and State Governments 
to particularly vulnerable areas in order to plan and prioritize mitigation measures through urgent 
execution of District Irrigation Plans, Crop Contingency Plans, Drinking water and MGNREGS related 
activities etc. It would appear that certain parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan 
have been particularly susceptible to drought episodes.

1.2.3 Geographical Spread of Drought

It has been shown that about 68% of cropped area in India is vulnerable to drought, of which 
33% receives less than 750 mm of mean annual rainfall and is classified as “chronically drought-prone” 
while 35% which receive mean annual rainfall of 750-1125 mm is classified as “drought-prone”. The 
drought-prone  areas  of  the  country  are  confined  primarily  to  the  arid,  semi-arid,  and  sub-humid 
regions of peninsular and western India.

Table 1.6 below indicates that while the droughts in 1965-67 and 1979-80 impacted comparatively 
high rainfall regions, whereas the droughts during 1972, 1987, and 2002 affected mostly semi-arid 
and  sub-humid  regions.  In  recent  years,  central,  north-west  and  peninsular  India  appear  to  have 
suffered frequent drought occurrences. These are traditionally low rainfall zones and the frequent 
failure of monsoons seems to have aggravated the intensity of droughts in these regions.

Irrigation systems are well developed in some parts of the country as depicted in Map 1.6.  It 
has been noticed that regions bestowed with assured irrigation have tended to escape the adverse 
impact of poor monsoon rainfall to a large extent, as is often the case with many districts of Haryana 
and Punjab.

1.3   impAct of drought

Drought produces wide-ranging impacts that span across many sectors of the economy. The 
reverberations are felt by the society and economy much beyond the areas actually experiencing 
the onslaughts of physical drought because agricultural production and water resources are integral 
to our ability to produce goods and services. Drought affects the overall economy of the country at 
macro and micro economic levels, both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts are usually visible in 
falling agricultural production and heightened food insecurity among poor and vulnerable sections; 
depleted water levels; higher livestock and wildlife mortality; cattle and animal migration; damage to 
ecosystem from indiscriminate exploitation; increased fire hazards etc. Indirect impacts of drought 
can be gauged from the reduction in incomes for farmers and agribusinesses, increased prices for 
food and fodder, reduction in purchasing capacity and slump in consumption, default on agricultural 
loans, distress sale of agricultural land & livestock, rural unrest, shrinkage in avenues for agricultural 
employment etc.  These deleterious impulses have huge negative multiplier effects in the economy 
and society.The impacts of drought are generally categorized as economic, environmental, and social.
Economic  impacts  refer  to  production  losses  in  agriculture  and  related  sectors,  especially 
animal husbandry, dairy, poultry, horticulture and fisheries. It affects livelihoods and quality of life 
for the majority of farmers, share croppers, farm labourers, artisans, small rural businesses and rural 
population in general that is dependent on agriculture. All industries dependent upon the primary 
sector for raw materials suffer on account of reduced supplies and hardening prices. Drought thus 
causes a dampening impact on the economy by squeezing profit margins, drying up income and 
revenue streams and constricting employment avenues through disruption caused to supply chain 
managements, slowing down flow of credit and tax collections, depressing industrial and consumer 
demand, increased dependence on imports, and lowering of overall market sentiments.  

Environmental impacts can be gauged from low water levels in ground water and surface 
reservoirs, lakes and ponds, reduced flows in springs, streams and rivers, loss of forest cover, migration 
of wildlife and sharpening man-animal conflicts and general stress on biodiversity. Reduced stream 
flow  and  loss  of  wetlands  may  affect  levels  of  salinity.  Increased  groundwater  depletion  rates, 
and  reduced  recharge  may  damage  aquifers  and  adversely  affect  the  quality  of  water  (e.g.,  salt 
concentration, acidity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity) which in turn may lead to a permanent loss of 
biological productivity of soils. 

Social impacts are manifest in widespread disruption in rural society on account of out-
migration  of  the  population  from  drought  affected  areas,  rise  in  school  dropout  rates,  greater 
immiseration and indebtedness, alienation of land and livestock assets, malnutrition, starvation and 
loss of social status among the most vulnerable sections. The situation of scarcity in some cases may 
exacerbate social tensions and lead to erosion of social capital.

2.1  monitoring And eArly wArning systems

2.1.1 Need

Drought  is  a  complex  phenomenon  characterized  by  slow  onset.  Careful  monitoring  of  the 
symptoms  of  drought  and  early  warning  are  key  to  effective  management  of  the  calamity.  It  is 
essential that along with a drought monitoring system, medium and long term area specific plans be 
prepared for drought proofing of susceptible areas. In addition, contingency and Crisis Management 
Plans need to be formulated with care to deal with drought in the short term.  Such well conceived 
plans, when executed promptly, can go a long way in mitigating distress and disruption to the rural 
economy and society. The objectives behind an effective monitoring and early warning system are 
to: 

 y

 y

provide accurate and timely information on rainfall, crop sown area, data on soil moisture 
(wherever  possible),  stream  flow,  groundwater,  lake  and  reservoir  storage  at  the 
relevant spatial scale at the State / district  / sub-district levels.
detect  drought  conditions  as  early  as  possible  in  order  to  implement  District  Agriculture 
Contingency Plans and the Crisis Management Plan.
The development of such a system and its success depends on the coordinated efforts on the 
part of all affected parties viz. Government of India, State Governments, Scientific Institutions and 
farmers.

Institutional Mechanism for Drought Monitoring and Early Warning at the National and State 
Levels

The Central and State Governments should set up institutional mechanisms for drought monitoring 
and early warning at the National and State levels.  The  existing  capacities  of  these  institutions 
need  to  be enhanced and strengthened for the purposes of data collection, analysis, and derive 
meaningful and actionable conclusions.

The institutional arrangements for drought management at the  National  and  State  levels  are 

described below:

2.1.2  Institutional Structures
Government of India

1.     Central Drought Relief Commissioner (CDRC):

Additional Secretary in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) 
serves as the CDRC and is assisted by the Disaster Management (DM) Division in the Department. 
A Drought Management Cell in the DM Division is created to help collate information for diverse 
sources, monitor drought conditions, issue advisories, coordinate with other Ministries of the 
Central Government, State Governments and relevant agencies to mitigate/combat the effect 
of drought. 

19

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

2.    Crop Weather Watch Group

The Crop Weather Watch Group (CWWG), in the DAC&FW, can act as an Inter-Ministerial mechanism, 
which should meet at least once a week during June to September period to monitor drought 
situation in the country. The composition of the Group and the specific areas of responsibility 
are suggested in Table 2.1 below.

This system would provide an integrated approach to drought management covering all aspects 
of drought: early warning and forecast, response and mitigation. The monitoring and early warning 
/ forecasting systems are discussed below. Response and mitigation measures will be discussed in 
subsequent sections.

State Government:
1.  State Drought Monitoring Centres :

The State Governments to consider setting up of Drought Monitoring Centres (DMCs)  staffed 
by  a  multi-disciplinary  team  of  meteorologists,  hydrologists  and  agriculture  scientists  to 
provide critical inputs to the State Executive Committee / State Disaster Management Departments 
/ Other Institutional Structures established by the States. The DMCs will collect, collate and analyse 
information  on  drought  parameters  from  National  and  State  level  agencies  e.g.,  the  IMD,  NRSC/
SRSCs, MNCFC, CWC, CGWB, State agricultural department etc. 

21

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

The outline for setting up DMCs at the State levels is provided in Annex 2. The State Governments 
can consider introducing suitable modifications in the constitution of these centres, taking 
into  consideration their  specific  needs  of  drought  monitoring. The DMCs will process the inputs 
received from sources to advise the State Governments/State Executive Committees(SECs) of any 
critical developments on drought. 

Scientific & Support Organisations:
1.  India Meteorological Department (IMD)

IMD  provides,  inter  alia,  national  weather  based  services  for  weather-sensitive  activities  like 
agricultural and is the principal government agency in all matters related to meteorology, seismology 
and allied subjects. IMD provides following weather forecasts;

 y

All India Weather Forecasts: It includes meteorological sub-division wise 5 day rainfall forecasts 
for 36 sub-divisions. 

 y Monsoon Forecasts: Operational forecasts for the South West Monsoon season (June – September) 
rainfall are issued in two stages. The first stage forecast is issued in April and the second stage 
forecast is issued in June. In the first stage, a forecast is made for the seasonal rainfall in the 
country  as  a  whole,  while  in  the  second  stage,  forecasts  are  made  for  the  four  homogenous 
regions and for June-July period.  
Severe Weather Warning: Meteorological sub-division wise 5 day extreme weather warnings are 
issued.
  District-wise rainfall Forecasts:  3 day district-level forecasts for rainfall are made.
In addition to these forecasts, IMD also issues other forecasts such as 3 hour now-casts for severe 

 y

 y

weather, specialized forecasts for tourism, highway, mountain weather, etc. 

Under Agro-Advisory Services, the Agricultural Meteorology Division of IMD (located at Pune), 
provides district level 5-day forecasts and crop wise agro-advisories. These advisories are prepared in 
collaboration with Agro-Met Field Units (AMFU), located in State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and 
ICAR centres. 

2.  Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre(MNCFC)

MNCFC was established as an attached office of DAC&FW in 2012 to use space technology for 
agricultural  assessment.  MNCFC,  operationally,  carries  out  drought  assessment  and  monitoring 
under the National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS) after the 
technology was transferred from the National Remote Sensing Centre in the Department of Space 
(Government of India).  District/sub-district level monthly drought assessments are carried out for 14 
major drought-prone agricultural States of India under the NADAMS project. The drought assessment 
is  carried  out  in  the  MNCFC  using  long-term  satellite  data  (NOAA-AVHRR,  MODIS,  Resourcesat  
2 AWiFS) on multiple vegetation indices, Rainfall Deficiency (or SPI) using meteorological data, Soil 
Moisture Index (from agro-meteorological modeling and satellite data), irrigation statistics and sown 
area figures. The monthly reports are made available in the public domain (www.ncfc.gov.in) for use 
of all concerned States and National agencies.

22

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

3.  Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA)

The  CRIDA,  Hyderabad  and  the All India Coordinated Research Projects on Agro-meteorology 
and  Dryland  Agriculture  (AICRPAM  and  AICRPDA),  each  with  25  centres  under  SAUs  across  the 
country  take  part  in  drought  studies  pertaining  to  assessment,  mitigation,  risk  transfer, 
and  development  of  decision  support  software  for  drought-prone  States.    CRIDA  has  prepared 
comprehensive  District  Agriculture  Contingency  Plans  for  more  than  600  districts  in  the  country, 
which State Governments and district level authorities can use as guidance documents to deal with 
drought.

4. Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR)
The Central Water Commission (CWC) and the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) under the 
(MoWR, RD & GR) are the two lead organizations in the country which monitor reservoir and ground 
water status. The data on river flows, reservoir storage levels and groundwater status can prove to 
be extremely useful in making a realistic assessment of water availability for agricultural crops in the 
event of drought like developments.  

5. Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO): 

ISRO is a premium organization of the country with the mission to harness space technology 
for national development. Two major centres of ISRO viz., Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad 
and National Remote Sensing Centres, Hyderabad carry out applications related to remote sensing, 
including those in agriculture. These Centres, along with 4 Regional Remote Sensing Centres, located 
in  Bengaluru,  Kolkata,  Jodhpur  and  Nagpur  can  provide  R&D  and  technical  support  for  drought 
assessment/monitoring activities through satellite data products available on Meteorological and 
Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC) and Bhuvan platforms. The satellite derived 
products  available  on  Bhuvan  (http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/)  can  be  useful  for  drought  assessment, 
including the computation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Soil moisture etc. 

6.  State Remote Sensing Application Centres (SRSACs)

Most  State  Governments  have  established  state  level  Remote  Sensing  Application  Centres 
realizing the potential of remote sensing techniques. Many of these centres have matured over a 
period of time with required infrastructure and human resources for carrying out remote sensing 
applications including those critical for agriculture. These centres have not only participated in many 
national  level  programmes  but  have  developed  valuable  State  level  geospatial  database.  These 
centres can help the State Governments in satellite data analysis for agricultural drought assessment. 

2.1.3 Key Variables for Monitoring Drought

State  Governments  monitor  drought  by  obtaining  information  from  various  sources  on  key 
variables of drought which include rainfall, reservoir / lake water levels, surface water / groundwater, 
soil moisture and sowing / crop conditions  etc.

Data Sources for Key Variables

Rainfall

Reservoir and Lake Storage  / Level
Impacts – distress sale and migration of cattle, human migration, fodder availability, drinking 
water, animal health, employment opportunities in agriculture sector

The IMD and State Governments collect data on rainfall every day during the rainy season. The 
IMD maintains its network of weather stations throughout the country. Within the State Government, 
data are collected at the Tehsil / Taluka / Block level(s), generally by the Revenue Department which is 
entrusted with the responsibility of collecting rainfall data at the district and Tehsil levels. The actual 
rainfall is compared with the Long Period Average (LPA), which is standardized on a daily, weekly 
and monthly basis. Such a comparison provides information on the deficit or excess of rainfall in 
a particular sub-division for a certain period. Satellite derived rainfall products, such as those from 
INSAT 3D and      INSAT 3DR can also be used to assess deviation of rainfall at spatial scales in different 
time scales (daily, weekly and fortnightly).  

Daily  rainfall  information  could  be  collected  and  submitted  in  Form  No.  1,  included  in  the 

Annex 1. 

Storage Water Levels in Reservoirs

Reservoir storage data is an useful indicator for water availability. Since reservoir storage data is 
available on a regular basis, it may help provide clear indication of possible water shortages in areas 
dependent on the surface water storage systems. The Central Water Commission (CWC) monitors and 
compiles reservoir storage data for 91 major reservoirs in the country (http://www.cwc.nic.in/rsms/
index.asp). A periodic report on available live reservoir storage for 91 major reservoirs in the country 
is published by CWC regularly (http://www.cwc.nic.in/).  In addition, the water resources departments 
in the States monitor daily reservoir level data for important reservoirs/tanks etc. State Governments 
need to plan for the use of reservoir storage as per their reservoir operation rules, which ought to lay 
down the priority for the use of available water among competing demands, e.g. drinking, urban and 
industrial use, irrigation, etc. 

Information on water storage in important State /Union Territory owned reservoirs by the State/

UT authorities could be provided in Form No. 2(A), included in Annex 1.

Stream Flow Data Monitoring

The  CWC  carries  out  extensive  stream  flow  data  monitoring  in  the  country.  The  CWC  has 
established  a  network  of  hydrological  observation  stations  in  all  major  river  basins.  Hydro-
Meteorological  Sites  (HMS)  of  CWC  are  stations  responsible  for  generating  the  stream  flow  data.  
Recently, a web based water resources information system called ‘India-WRIS’ has been developed 

24

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

and information on the water resources in the country, including observed stream flow data for all 
unclassified river systems is available in the public domain (http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wris.
html). The stream- flow data for restricted/classified river systems can be obtained for this purpose by 
State Governments. Information on Stream Flow Data may be collected in Form 2(B) in Annexure-1.

Groundwater Level

The groundwater table depth below ground level is one of the important factors responsible 
for contribution of base flow in streams, ponds and lakes particularly during dry non rainy season. 
Similarly, groundwater levels are also affected due to occurrence of low recharge, either due to lack 
of adequate rainfall or poor water conservation practices. 

The  Central  Ground  Water  Board  (CGWB),  and  the  State  Groundwater  Departments  monitor 
groundwater table (GWT) depths across the country. This monitoring is usually done during pre and 
post monsoon seasons.  In various States, GWT depth is monitored four times a year, whereas in some 
regions, the GWT depths are monitored on monthly time scale. Form 2(c) in Annexure-1 provides a 
template for collection and monitoring of information on groundwater. 

25

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Sowing and Crop Conditions

An  important  indicator  of  drought  is  the  total  area  sown. The  State  Government  agriculture 
departments provide information on sowing on a weekly basis. A delayed sowing indicates rainfall 
deficiency  and  is  a  portent  for  the  onset  of  drought.  Reports  on  crop  conditions  also  provide  an 
indication of the severity of the drought situation e.g. wilting of crops signifies soil moisture stress.  
The  agriculture  contingency  plans  and  other  mitigation  measures  are  activated  on  the  basis  of 
reports on different crops sown during the monsoon.

Weekly Information on the area and crop-wise sowing can be provided in Form No. 3 and Form 

No. 4 respectively.  These forms are included in the Annex 1.

Standardized Precipitation Index

The  Standardized  Precipitation  Index  (SPI)  is  a  relatively  new  drought  index  based  only  on 
precipitation. The SPI assigns a single numeric value to precipitation, which can be compared across 
regions and time scales with markedly different climates. This spatial and temporal flexibility allows 
the SPI to be useful in both short-term agricultural and long-term hydrological applications. 

Reservoir Storage Index

The  Surface  Water  Supply  Index  (SWSI)  integrates  reservoir  storage,  stream-flow,  and  two 
precipitation types (snow and rain) at high elevations into a single index number. SWSI is relatively 
easy to calculate and it gives a representative measure of water availability across a river basin or 
selected region/province. It is, however, unlikely that it could be successfully used for large regions 
with significant spatial hydrological variability since the weights may differ substantially from one 
part of the region to another.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is based on the concept that vegetation vigour is 
an indicator of water availability or lack thereof.  It demonstrates the effects of climate on vegetation 

26

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

in terms of its absorptive capacity in visible light but little in the near-infrared spectrum. The difference 
of  visible  and  near-infrared  reflectance  represents  photosynthetically  active  vegetation;  this 
information is used to construct a vegetation index. The lowering of the vegetation index indicates 
moisture stress in vegetation, resulting from prolonged rainfall deficiency. High NDVI values might 
reflect ideal growing conditions if vegetation greenness is higher than that encountered in other 
years.

Normalized Difference Wetness Index

Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWI) is expected to give the vegetation or crop turgidity 
and health. It is based on the use of Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) band, which is sensitive to moisture 
available in soil as well as in crop canopy. In the beginning of the cropping season, soil background is 
dominant which makes SWIR sensitive to soil moisture in the top 1-2 cm. As the crop progresses, SWIR 
becomes sensitive to leaf moisture content. NDWI using SWIR can complement NDVI for drought 
assessment particularly in the beginning of the cropping season. Higher values of NDWI signify more 
surface wetness.

Moisture Adequacy Index

The  Moisture  Adequacy  Index  (MAI)  is  obtained  from  weekly  water  balance.  Drought  impact 
is related to moisture availability at certain crop growth stages. Hence, categories of MAI (severity) 
at  different  growth  stages  are  integrated  into  a  single  index  value  to  identify  drought  impact  on 
a particular crop. The Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Jodhpur monitors agricultural 
drought in the Indian arid regions by using MAI.

Levels of Early Warning
 The early warning system should include the following:

1.   Receipt of forecasts, early warning signals, and advisories from scientific institutions;

2.   Monitor key drought indices at the National / State / District / Sub-district levels using composite 

index of various drought indicators;

3.   Efficient dissemination of early warning so as to activate contingency measures.

Capacity Development for Drought Monitoring

The  States  are  advised  to  undertake  capacity  building  activities  from  time  to  time  for  all  the 
stakeholders engaged in drought monitoring, response and mitigation with the support of relevant 
National and State Institutes.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

      3.1   rAtionAle And objectives

‘Drought declaration’ signifies the beginning of Government response to conditions representing 
a drought situation. The decision to declare drought over a specified administrative unit (District/
Taluka/Tehsil/  Block/Gram  Panchayat  level)  should  be  guided  by  objective  parameters  and  made 
without  undue  delay  so  that  relief  assistance  and  concessions  can  be  provided  to  the  drought-
affected people in time. 

There is substantial variance in the quality of drought monitoring and the methodology and 
parameters adopted in the declaration of drought among States. Many States still continue to rely on 
the traditional practice such as the annewari/ paisewari/ girdawari systems of eye estimation and crop 
cutting experiments to assess if the extent of damage to crops warranted a declaration of drought. In 
such cases, the final annewari/ paisewari/ girdawari estimates for kharif crops are generally available 
by December or after, whereas those for rabi crops are available not before March. Relief operations 
are mounted in drought affected areas by the State Governments after the notification of drought 
using,  inter  alia,  funds  available  under  the  State  Disaster  Response  Fund  (SDRF).    In  the  event  of 
drought of a severe nature, the State Government may seek assistance from the Central Government 
including financial assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).

The Central Government dispatches inter-ministerial teams to carry out assessment of drought 
and  recommend  the  quantum  of  relief  only  after  the  State  Government  issues  a  notification  of 
drought and submits a Memorandum for financial assistance from the NDRF.  Therefore,  delay on 
the part of State Governments in making the determination and declaration of drought on account 
of the preference for extensive field surveys and crop cutting experiments over other quicker means, 
is  likely  to  set  a  train  of  delays  in  motion,  making  it  difficult  for  the  much  needed  relief  to  reach 
the  affected  population  in  time. The  Government  of  India  revised  its  norms  in  2015  to  lower  the 
eligibility threshold from 50% loss to 33% loss to sown crops on account of drought to qualify for 
relief assistance. It was, however, noticed that some States still continue to recognise a minimum loss/
damage of 50% to sown crops (i.e, annewari /paisewari/ girdawari less than 50%) for the declaration 
of an area as drought affected. 

Technological  advances  have  to  a  large  extent,  obviated  the  need  for  complete  and  sole 
dependence  on  crop  loss  assessment  based  on    annewari  /  paisewari  /  girdawari  or  crop  cutting 
assessments in the determination of drought.  It is possible to arrive at an objective, timely and accurate 
assessment of drought through the establishment of an elaborate scientific drought monitoring system. 
Meteorological,  remote  sensing  and  hydrological  data  can  be  accessed  by  the  State  Governments 
from Central and State agencies, and processed quickly to arrive at fairly credible inferences on the 
emergence and intensification of drought-like conditions in any part within their territories. 

It is acknowledged that a combination of carefully chosen indicators and indices derived from 
satellite / hydrological observations is capable of identifying areas with drought like propensities 
which will be discussed in the course of this Chapter.  However, it needs to be conceded that drought, 
as opposed to most other calamities, is a highly complex phenomenon, and available technology not 
only has inherent limitations but the shortcomings are sometimes compounded by poor availability 
of reliable data.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

3.2  broAd indices And fActors

On the basis of wide-ranging consultations with domain specialists, five categories of indices 
are recommended for developing a monitoring matrix for drought. The five categories of indices 
are  Rainfall, Vegetation, Water,  Crop  and  others.  Rainfall  is  considered  to  be  the  most  important 
indicator and therefore related meteorological data should be mandatorily considered in making any 
assessment of drought. The other indices are to be evaluated in conjunction with the rainfall related 
data to assess the impact of rainfall deficiency. 

State Governments are expected to develop monitoring systems at the smallest administrative 
unit  levels  (e.g.  Hobli/  sub-division/ Tehsil/ Taluk/  Block/Mandal/  Gram  Panchayat  etc.),  to  enable 
generation of sharper and credible observation data that are reflective of ground realities. In addition, 
agencies of Central and State Governments would be required to streamline and strengthen data 
collection  system  for  drought  variables.  In  addition,  Standard  Operating  Procedures  need  to  be 
considered for collection, updation of data related to the drought variables. 

3.2.1: Rainfall Related Indices

As mentioned earlier, Rainfall is the most important indicator in the determination of drought. 
A departure in rainfall from its normal value in terms of magnitude and distribution i.e., from the 
Long Period Average (LPA) of 30 years or more is considered as fairly credible indicator of drought     
(Table-3.1).  In addition, other indicators such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and occurrence 
of Dry Spells are also recommended. SPI is used as an indicator of deviation of rainfall from the normal 
and can serve as a more robust statistical indicator under certain conditions as compared to simple 
rainfall deviations. Dry spell, in contrast, is an indicator of anomalies in the distribution of rainfall.  
A.   Rainfall  Deviation: The  rainfall  deviation  (RFdev)  which  is  expressed  in  percentage  terms  is 

calculated as below:

RFdev = {(RFi – RFn)/RFn}*100

Where RFi is current rainfall for a comparable period (in mm) and RFn is the normal rainfall (at 
least 30 years average) for the same period (in mm). The IMD classification of rainfall deviation is 
given in Table-3.1.

This parameter needs to be considered with caution in extreme high and low rainfall regions.

B.    Dry Spell: A dry spell is a short period, usually 4 weeks (upto 3 weeks in case of light soils), of low 
rainfall or no rainfall. Thus, consecutive 3-4 weeks after the due date for the onset of monsoon 
with  rainfall  less  than  50%  of  the  normal  in  each  of  the  weeks  is  defined  as  a  Dry  spell. This 
indicator is important in that it quantifies the extent of intra-season rainfall variations which is 
so critical for the health of crops and maintenance of soil and hydrological regime. In regions 
normally associated with high rainfall (south west monsoon rainfall >1400mm), the dry spell 
criteria may need to be recalibrated in synch with the agro-climatic conditions.

C.    Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) expresses the actual rainfall as a standardized departure 
with  respect  to  rainfall  probability  distribution  function  and  hence,  the  index  has  gained 
importance  in  recent  years  as  a  potential  drought  indicator  permitting  comparisons  across 
space and time. The computation of SPI requires long term data on precipitation to determine 
the  probability  distribution  function  (gamma  distribution)  which  is  then  transformed  to  a 
normal distribution with zero as mean and standard deviation of one. The longer the reference 
period  to  calculate  the  distribution  parameters,  the  greater  the  likelihood  of  obtaining  more 
accurate results (e.g. 50 years data will be better than that for 30 years). Thus, the values of SPI 
are expressed in standard deviations, positive SPI indicating greater than median precipitation 
and negative values indicating less than median precipitation. SPI can be ideally calculated on 
the basis of a minimum of 30 years of historical data for a station. SPI should be computed only 
for the monthly time scale.   Fitting appropriate statistical distribution to the time series rainfall 
data is critical for an accurate SPI computation and interpretation with the help of expert advice. 
However, sparse availability of long term Block/Taluk/Mandal level quality data in many States is 
a limitation in computation of SPI. The States are advised to refer to URL of IMD viz. imdpune.gov.
in  for SPI data and related information.

SPI value less than -1.0 with or without dry spells, and there is an adverse impact on area under 
sowing, vegetative health and soil moisture, as expressed through the vegetation soil moisture 
indices. 

3.2.2 Remote Sensing based Vegetation Indices

Advancements in satellite remote sensing technology has enabled regular monitoring of crop 
conditions/vigour  over  large  regions.    Among  the  various  spectral  vegetation  indices  commonly 
derived from remote sensing data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is most widely 
used for operational assessment of drought owing to the ease in calculation and interpretation and 
also its ability to partially compensate for the effects of atmosphere, illumination geometry etc. NDVI 
is derived using the formula (NIR – Red) / (NIR + Red), where NIR and Red are the reflectance in visible 
and near infrared channels. Water, clouds and snow have higher reflectance in the visible region and 
consequently NDVI assumes negative values for these features. Bare soil and rocks exhibit similar 
reflectance in both visible and near IR regions and the index values are near zero. The NDVI values 
for vegetation generally range from 0.2 to 0.6, the higher index values being associated with greater 
green leaf area and biomass.

 Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) band is sensitive to moisture available in soil as well as in crop canopy. 
In the beginning of the cropping season, soil background is dominant hence SWIR is sensitive to soil 
moisture in the top 1-2 cm. As the crop growth progresses, SWIR becomes sensitive to leaf moisture 
content.  SWIR  band  provides  only  surface  wetness  information.  Normalized  Difference  Wetness 
Index (NDWI), computed using SWIR data, can complement NDVI for drought assessment particularly 
in the beginning of the cropping season. NDWI is derived as follows: NDWI = (NIR-SWIR) / (NIR+SWIR) 
where, NIR and SWIR are the reflected radiation in Near-Infrared and Shortwave Infrared channels. 
Higher values of NDWI signify more surface wetness.

Satellite  based  crop  condition  anomalies  which  point  towards  agricultural  drought  can  be 
generated by computing Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) or NDVI/NDWI deviations from the normal 
years.  Normal  NDVI/NDWI  is  generated  by  averaging  the  NDVI/NDWI  of  at  least  3  recent  normal 
years. Such comparisons enable minimization of the effect on account of the differences in cropping 
pattern and crop calendar.

NDVIdev = {(NDVIi – NDVIn)/NDVIn}*100
NDWIdev = {(NDWIi – NDWIn)/NDWIn}*100
Where subscript ‘n’ refers to normal value and ‘i’ to current period.

34

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

The value so obtained for a given NDVI  o r   N D W I   ranges from–1 to +1. A negative number or 
a number close to zero is indicative of poor vegetation and a number close to >0.6—1.0 signifies 
healthy vegetation in the case of NDVI and absence of water stress in the case of NDWI. 

NDVI/NDWI deviation of -20 to -30% represents moderate drought conditions and that of <-30% 
represents severe conditions. However, these values may be different for different agro-ecological 
regions and cropping patterns. 

To combine the NDVI and NDWI deviation category, the poorest among the two will be used, for 
example, if NDVI deviation is moderate and NDWI deviation is ‘Severe’, then overall category will be 
‘severe’.

The current period values of Vegetation and Wetness index values can be compared with long-
term data (at least ten years) by computing Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). The VCI compares 
the observed NDVI and NDWI to the range of values observed for the same period in previous years. 
The VCI is expressed in %age and gives an idea where the current value is placed within the extreme 
values (minimum and maximum) in the historical datasets normalized to a scale of 0 – 100%. Lower 
and higher values indicate bad and good vegetation state conditions, respectively. VCI is computed 
as under:

VCI (NDVI) = [(NDVIcurr-NDVImin)/(NDVImax-NDVImin)] x 100     
VCI (NDWI) = [(NDWIcurr-NDWImin)/(NDWImax-NDWImin)] x 100     

Where the subscript ‘curr’ refers to Current Period Value, ‘min’ and ‘max’ refer to minimum and 

maximum values of VI in historical dataset for the same period and same location.

For using VCI in drought assessment following threshold values can be used as given in Table 3.3.

Table 3.3: Classification of Vegetation Condition based on VCI value

VCI Value (%)

Vegetation Condition

 60-100
40-60
0-40

Good
 Fair
Poor

While combining VCI of NDVI and NDWI, the minimum of the two values can be taken, i.e if at 
least one is in ‘very poor’ condition, the category will be considered as severe. If both are ‘poor’ or at 
least one is ‘poor’, then the category will be taken to be Normal.

VCI is a promising index in that it has the advantage of being comparable over space and time 
on account of the normalization of differences in cropping patterns, crop calendars, atmospheric 
parameters. The limitation arises from the requirement of long term time series data for NDVI/NDWI 
(at least 10 years) and the risk of VCI values getting affected by the differences in cropping patterns, 
crop calendars and atmospheric parameters. The computation and interpretation of VCI is complex 
and require the services of experts (from SRSCs/NRSC/MNCFC). 

35

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

The data for the current season and historical NDVI/NDWI may be sourced from State Remote 
Sensing Centres / MNCFC / NRSC / NDVI / NDWI data of moderate spatial resolution is recommended 
for agricultural drought assessment at sub-district level. The best possible spatial resolution should 
be  preferred  (Resourcesat  AWiFS  of  56m  resolution  or  MODIS  with  250m  /  500m  resolution).  Use 
of coarse resolution data of 1 km is not desirable for sub-district level assessments. VCI data needs 
to be interpreted with caution when the crops are in maximum vegetative phase. It may be borne 
in mind while using satellite based vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) that these indices may provide 
good indication of crop condition and bio-mass, which may not always offer close proximation of the 
estimate of crop yield.  

The National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS), developed by 
the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), and currently being implemented by the Mahalanobis 
National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) issues fortnightly/ monthly drought assessment reports on 
detailed crop condition during the kharif season for 14 agriculturally important and vulnerable States 
such as Andhra Pradesh,  Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, 
Madhya  Pradesh,  Odisha,  Rajasthan,  Telangana,  Tamil  Nadu  and  Uttar  Pradesh  at  present.  These 
reports  provide  values  for  Normalized  Difference Vegetation  Index  (NDVI),  Normalized  Difference 
Wetness Index (NDWI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI).

3.2.3   Crop Situation Related Indices
3.2.3.1  Area Under Sowing

The extent of sowing is an important indicator of the spread and severity of drought. Sowing 
operations are linked to rainfall and availability of water during initial growth stage. Farmers in rainfed 
regions commence sowing operations mostly with the onset of the monsoon. If sowing fails due to 
water stress, farmers tend to  sow a second or even a  third time. Therefore, the area under sowing 
provides reliable information on the availability of water for agricultural operations.

Drought conditions could be said to exist if the total sown area under kharif crops was less than 
33.3% of the total normal sown area by the end of July/August, depending upon the schedule for 
sowing in individual States due to failure of rains or very late arrival of monsoon. In such situations, 
even if rainfall revives in the subsequent months, there is little possibility of full recovery and the 
agricultural  production  is  likely  to  take  a  substantial  hit.      However,  the  conditions  will  indicate 
portents for drought of a ‘severe’ nature will appear strong, if the area under crops falls to 50% of 
the normal by the end of July / August.  State Governments should, therefore, consider the status 
of  coverage by the end of July/August to see if the shortfall in sown area is significantly short of the 
total normal sown area.

In	the	case	of	Rabi	crops,	coverage	of	sowing	of	less	than	50%	of	the	total	normal	sown	area	during	
October-November	is	a	strong	indicator	of	a	drought	like	development.	State	Agriculture	Departments

3.2.3.2 Soil Moisture Based Indices

Available soil moisture is a very relevant indicator of drought, especially in rainfed regions. The 
soil moisture based indices could be calculated using a simple region wide soil-moisture balance 
methodology which entails collecting some of the base-line data related to soil properties, climatic 
parameters and crop growth pattern. Basically, soil moisture balance calculates the amount of rainfall 
available to crops depending upon crop water requirement, climatic evaporative demand and soil 
water holding capacity. This calculation may be carried out by involving technical experts like Agro-
meteorologists / Agricultural Physicists / Agricultural Engineers working with State Departments of 
Agriculture or State Agricultural Universities or ICAR institutes located in the States. It is suggested 
that one of the two soil moisture based indices viz., (a) Percent Available Soil Moisture (PASM), or 
(b)  Moisture  Adequacy  Index  (MAI)  is  used.  These  indices  may  be  calculated  at  weekly  intervals 
and averaged over dominant crop growth stages such as “Early Growth Stage”, “Vegetative Growth 
Stage” and “Reproductive Stage”. These indices should be combined with other indicators for the 
determination of drought.

Though  soil  moisture  is  an  important  parameter  governing  crop  growth,  there  is  only  a 
rudimentary  network  of  agro-meteorological  observatories  which  record  soil  moisture  regularly. 
These  agro-meteorological  observatories  are  in  many  cases,  located  at  /or  operated  with  the 
assistance of State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) or Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) 
institutes.    Satellite  transmitted  data  from  existing  network  of  ISRO  Agro-Met  Stations  (AMS)  and 
those stations proposed by IMD can provide valuable insight into the soil moisture and moisture 
adequacy in agricultural systems. However, soil moisture is highly dynamic in space and time and 
is measured using soil sensors or satellite remote sensing. Agro-meteorological models have been 
developed for the estimation of soil moisture, yet the limitation of these parameters stem from the 
fact that the information is limited to the top-soil and at a very coarse resolution.   

The data on the following needs to be collected at weekly intervals for computing soil moisture 

based indices with the aid of agro-meteorological models. 
(i)  Soil water constants: These are static soil properties of Field Capacity (FC), Permanent Wilting 
Point  (PWP)  constants  and  soil  depth  of  the  dominant  soil  type  in  the  region. These  may  be 
obtained  from  the  State  Departments  of  Agriculture  or  inferred  from  soil  maps  prepared  by 
ICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS&LUP) or Soil and Land Use 
Survey of India (SLUSI) in the DAC&FW.   These constants can be calculated from soil texture data 
using pedo-transfer functions (i.e. relationship  between soil water contents and sand/silt/day 
content) if the said organizations are unable to provide the requisite data. 

(ii)  Crop  Calendar:  The  normal  growth  period  (sowing  and  harvesting  time)  for  the  one/two 
dominant crops in the region and durations of the “Early Growth Stage”, “Vegetative Stage” and 
“Reproductive Stage”.

(iii)  Weather Parameter: In season rainfall data.
(iv)  Climatic data: It  relates  to  the  climatic  water  demand  of  the  atmosphere  and  is  captured  in 
terms of the Climatic Potential Evapo-transpiration (PET) / Reference Evapo-transpiration (RET) 
of the region. These are calculated by IMD / State Irrigation Departments / State Agricultural 
Universities/ICAR institutes using climatic data and standard methodologies.  

37

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

(A)   Percent Available Soil Moisture (PASM)

PASM  is  derived  from  observed  moisture  sensor  data  or  sample  soil-water  balance  model 

following the ‘bucket approach’ and using the following formula:

PASM = [(SMw - PWP) / (FC - PWP)] * 100

Where SMw is the weekly calculated volumetric soil moisture (vol/vol) for the current week, FC 
is the field capacity of soil (vol/vol) and PWP is the permanent wilting point of the soil (vol/vol). The 
PASM based classification is given in Table 3.4.

PASM  is  an  useful  indicator  of  agricultural  drought.  However,  the  limitations  stem  from  the 
lack of representative large area soil moisture measurements or data on soil and meteorology. It is 
suggested that the States invest in setting up Soil Moisture Monitoring Stations and automated rain 
gauges as part of a drought monitoring system.

* The ranges and class may be suitably modified by the State depending upon the local dominant crop types, soil properties, etc. in 
consultation with experts.

(B)   Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI)

Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI) is also based on a calculation of weekly soil water balance, and 
is equal to the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of Actual Evapo-transpiration (AET) to the Potential/
Reference  Evapo-transpiration  (PET  or  RET)  following  a  soil–water  balancing  approach  during 
different phenological stages of a crop. Thus, MAI is obtained by using the following equation: 

MAI = [AET/PET] * 100

The MAI values and corresponding drought classes are expressed in Table 3.5 below.

These are important indices for rainfed areas and estimated by considering rainfall, available

c.

The computation of MAI generally does not take into account irrigation because of the non-
availability of irrigation data related to roster schedules and quantum of release. Therefore, the
application of MAI to irrigated areas is recommended where appropriate data on irrigation is
available.

The calculation of soil moisture from models due to the non-availability of information on soil
profiles may lead to the estimation of soil moisture of the surface soil alone.

3.2.4  Hydrological Indices 

Depletion  in  stream-flow,  reduction  in  reservoir  storages  /  water  spread  area  and  the  rate  of 
ground water table depletion can serve as useful indicators of drought. These indices are subject to 
availability of relevant data from Central Water Commission (CWC), the Central Ground Water Board 
and State agencies, etc.

3.2.4.1 Reservoir Storage Index (RSI)

The availability of water in reservoirs can act as an effective foil against drought. The reservoir 
storage status derived from percentage of storage deficit vis-à-vis long term averages can provide 
an indication of drought (Table 3.6). 

Table 3.6: Category of deficit based on %age deficit in live storage volume of reservoir

However, the CWC monitors storage data of selected major reservoirs only. Real / near real time 
data from minor / medium storage reservoirs, if gathered by the State Governments, can be useful 
in making assessments of hydrological drought and the possible impact on irrigated crops. Similarly, 
developing rainfall-run off relationship models will help in prognostic assessment of surface water 
availability. States may consider installing stream gauging stations - one for every 100 sq km to help 
develop prognostic tools for understanding supply availability vis a vis demand.

The storage records are maintained for select reservoirs and therefore an obvious limitation of 
RSI is that the application of this index can be useful only for those areas that are dependent for their 
agriculture on reservoir supplies.

3.2.4.2 Groundwater Drought Index (GWDI)

The rate of depletion of groundwater table is useful for making an assessment of groundwater 

availability for agriculture and drinking water supply purposes.   

 The monthly groundwater (GW) table records are required for a minimum period of 10 years 
for computation of mean value of monthly ground water depletion rate.  When rate of depletion of 
groundwater table in a given month/period is more than the corresponding mean value then it is an 
indication of water deficit. The computation procedure for Ground  Water Drought Index (GWDI) is 
as follows:  

Where, 

GWDIij = Groundwater Drought Index  for ith month and jth year.

MGWDj = Mean depth to groundwater table below surface (in meter)

GWDij = Depth to groundwater table in  ith month and jth year (in meter).

GWDimax = Maximum depth to groundwater table in  ith month in available data set for n number 
of years (in meter).

i  = 1, 2, 3, 4, …………, 12.  

j  = 1, 2, 3, …………., n.

n = total numbers of years for which monthly groundwater records are used.

3.2.4.3  Stream-Flow Drought Index (SFDI)

The amount of water flows in streams and rivers can provide valuable insights on hydrological 
drought. The flows in streams display high seasonal variability necessitating estimation of variable 
truncation levels for all twelve months in a year. The truncation level is an analytical interpretation 
of expected availability of water flow in a river (refer Table 3.8). The truncation level is defined as 
75% dependable  flow  (discharge)  at  a  given  time  and  for  a  given  site  over  a  month  long  time 
period.  Therefore, average monthly flow records are required to be used to derive flow duration 
curves  for  determination  of  monthly  truncation  level.  Water  flow  in  a  river  or  stream  below  the 
truncation level is indicative of a drought like scenario. 

The  severity  of  drought  event  would  be  classified  using  a  stream  flow  drought  index  (SFDI) 

defined as a function of : 

i.

ii.

the ratio of deficit flow volume to corresponding volume at the truncation levels; and

the  ratio  of  duration  of  deficit  flow  to  the  maximum  expected  duration  of  the  independent
stream flow drought event.

Where, 
Vd  = deficit flow volume, 
VTL = corresponding flow volume expected at TL flow 
de = duration of independent drought event, and 
dm = maximum duration of an independent drought event (=365 days).

Stream  flow  records  (Average  10-  daily  or  monthly  discharge  data)  are  maintained  by  CWC 
which can be sourced by the States for assessment of drought. The SFDI is straightaway applicable 
for the river systems having perennial flow characteristics. In case of intermittent and ephemeral 
flow characteristics, joint probability distribution approach is required to be used for estimation of 
truncation level. The SFDI suffers from limitation arising from the non-availability of historical data 
(30 years or more) which may sometimes result in erroneous assessment of stream-flow drought 
characteristics, particularly with regard to non snowfed river systems.

Current  agricultural  and  non-agricultural  wages  compared  with  normal  times  (see  Form  9, 
Annexure-1);
Supply of food grains, and price situation of essential commodities (see Form 10,     Annexure-1).
These  socio-economic  indicators  may  aid  State  Governments  in  fine  tuning  the  assessment 
of drought. However, State Governments will need to set up credible data bases and monitoring 
systems for objective evaluation of distress migration, price trends of fodder and food commodities, 
availability of drinking water etc. 

3.2.6  Ground Truthing or Verification

It is acknowledged by experts that parameters identified for assessment of drought while useful, 
suffer from deficiencies on account of limitations of the available technology, unavailability of a wide 
network of monitoring stations, paucity and unreliability of long term data.  It is, therefore, essential 
for  a  realistic  and  credible  determination  of  a  complex  phenomenon  such  as  drought,  that  the 
matrix based  analysis  (as  at  Table  3.10)  is  supplemented  in  the  event  that  values  in  the  matrix 
indicate  a  ‘Moderate’ or ‘Severe’ drought, by a quick field level sample survey. The findings of the 
quick  sample  survey  shall  be  conclusive  in  the  determination,  intensity  and  spatial  extent  of 
drought. 

The Ground  Truthing (GT) needs to be conducted in each of the 10% of the drought affected  
villages, selected on a random basis. In each of the selected villages, representative locations (about 
5 sites for each of the major crops), may be inspected for data collection.   The GT shall preferably 
be conducted using a smart phone based App.  The app shall record the GPS coordinates of the site 
and the photo of the state of crop, with the provision to upload these parameters on a computer 
server for archiving for post-facto analysis. Inspection of isolated and small fields (<1 acre) should 
be  avoided  to  improve  the  quality  of  field  data.  The  States  may  identify  the  relevant  crop/field 
attribute data for the Mobile App.  Appropriate inspection protocols may be developed for providing 
guidance in collection of data.  An estimation of crop damage / loss of 33% or more on the basis of 
field verification will qualify for the declaration of drought.  However, for the drought to qualify as one 
of a ‘severe’ nature, the estimation of damage / loss to crops should be more than 50%. Form-11 at 
Annexure-1 has been suggested for the compilation of village wise data on damage to sown crops. 

It is desirable that declaration of drought by the State Governments is supported by the matrix 

based analysis and field level verification / GT.

3.3  process for the determinAtion of drought 

The Drought Monitoring Cells (DMCs) in the States will monitor data regularly on various critical 
parameters referred to earlier in this chapter and apprise the SEC/Disaster Management Department 
in  the  State  Government  on  the  spread  and  intensity  of  an  emerging  drought  like  situation.  As 
referred to earlier, the complexity of drought cannot be captured with the aid of a single indicator, 
but require a more comprehensive understanding of data on several parameters read in conjunction 
with  rainfall,  the  most  important  and  mandatory  parameter  in  any  determination  of  drought 
and bolstered by a field verification.  Table 3.10 sub para 3.3.1 below provides a simple matrix to 
help make an objective assessment of drought. 

3.3.1  Steps in the Determination of Drought
Following steps are suggested for the determination of drought: 
Step 1: Mandatory Indicators viz. RF deviation or SPI or Dry Spell will be considered as per matrix at 
Table 3.9 to assess if the first drought trigger is set off. 

Table 3.9:  Matrix for rainfall deviations and dry spells (Trigger-1)

Step 2: In the event that the first drought trigger is set off in Step 1, the Impact Indicators will 

be examined as per the matrix at Table 3.10.

The States may consider any three of the four types of the Impact Indicators (one from each) for  

assessment of drought, the intensity of the calamity and make a judgement. 

43

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Explanation :

The intensity of the drought will be contingent upon the values of at least three out of four 
Impact  Indicators  viz,  Agriculture,  Remote  Sensing,  Soil  Moisture  and  Hydrology  in  the  following 
manner: 

Severe drought:   if  all the selected 3 impact indicators are in Severe category  

 y
 y Moderate drought:  if two of the selected 3 impact indicators are in  ‘Moderate’ or ‘Severe’ class. 
 y Normal:  for all other cases. 
 y
 y

Trigger 2 will be set off in the event of a finding of ‘severe’ or ‘moderate’ drought. 
The State has an option to reduce the drought category by one rank (i.e. Severe to Moderate) if the 
irrigation percentage of the administrative region (District/Taluk/Block/Mandal), for which drought 
is being declared is more than 75%. However, in such a situation of reduction of drought intensity 
from ‘Moderate’ to ‘Normal’, the State Government will still be required to conduct field verification as 
prescribed in Step 3 below.  

Step 3:  In the event that trigger 2 is set off, States will conduct sample survey for ground truthing as 
described at 3.2.6 above and in order to make a final determination of drought.  The finding of field 
verification exercise will be the final basis for judging the intensity of drought as ‘severe’ or ‘moderate’.

44

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

3.4  declArAtion of drought

The  State  Governments  will  declare  drought  through  a  notification  specifying  clearly  the 
geographical extent and administrative units such as Gram Panchayats, Blocks, Mandals, Taluks, Sub-
division, Districts. Such notification will also indicate the level of severity of the drought (moderate or 
severe).  The validity of such notification will not be for more than 6 months unless de-notified earlier.  
The declaration of Kharif drought should not be done later than 30 October and the Rabi drought 
by 31 March. The State Governments will declare the calamity as “drought ” and not by any other 
nomenclature, if the conditions referred to in 3.3.1 are fulfilled (see Annexure-3).

Drought declaration in the early season

Drought declaration during August month may be carried-out, if the seasonal conditions signify 
drought like situation. Deficit rainfall in June and July with prolonged dry spells leading to significant 
reduction in crop sown area can trigger the declaration of early drought.

Indicators for early season drought declaration

Rainfall deficiency based on rainfall deviation or SPI and the dry spell as shown in Table 3.9 

continue to be mandatory for declaration.

Among the impact indicators, reduction in crop sown area or failed sowing, MAI, Ground water 
or Reservoir water index are important. NDVI is less effective when the canopy coverage is low. In 
such situation NDWI, a surface wetness indicator is preferred to NDVI.

3.5  memorAndum for finAnciAl AssistAnce

3.5.1  Submission of Memorandum for Financial assistance under NDRF
A  Memorandum  for  assistance  under  the  National  Disaster  Response  Fund  (NDRF)  will  be 
submitted within a week of the declaration of drought only if the calamity is of a severe nature.  
Only those items should be included in the Memorandum that are admissible as per extant guidelines 
of the Ministry of Home Affairs.   The Memorandum for assistance will mandatorily contain a copy 
of the State Government notification on drought, details of assessment of drought as per Table 3.10 
and  details  of  village-wise  field  verification  data  (see  Annexure-4).  The  State  Governments  will 
consider  the  overall  socio-economic  scenario  as  reflected  through  distress  migration,  fodder 
shortage,  food  and  drinking  water  scarcities,  abnormal  price  rise  in  food  commodities  and 
fodder,  malnutrition  among vulnerable sections for providing relief. 

45

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

3.6  timelines

States  will  notify  Kharif  drought  by  30  October  and  the  Rabi  drought  by  31  March.    The 
memorandum for assistance will be submitted to the DAC&FW within a week of the declaration, in 
case the drought is of serious nature.

The DAC&FW will constitute and dispatch an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) to the drought 
affected area within a week of receipt of the Memorandum from the State Government.  The IMCT 
will submit a report for the consideration of the Central Government within 7 days of all relevant 
information provided by the State Government following the visit to the drought affected areas.  The 
Central Government will take a final decision on the assistance to the State from the NDRF within a 
month of the receipt of the IMCT Report. 

The State Governments will ensure disbursement of agriculture input subsidy to affected farmers 
within one month from the date of receipt of Central assistance from the NDRF.  The timelines in the 
case of declaration of an early season drought will be suitable modified for the different activities 
enumerated above. Various instruments of Direct Benefit Transfer to beneficiaries will be employed 
to ensure efficiency and transparency in the process of fund transfer.  

3.7   direct benefit trAnsfer (dbt)

Direct Benefit Transfer is a major reform initiative launched by Government of India to re-engineer 
the  existing  cumbersome  delivery  processes  using  modern  Information  and  Communication 
Technology (ICT). This programme aims to transfer benefits directly into the bank/postal accounts, 
preferably Aadhaar seeded, of accurately targeted beneficiaries. In a nutshell, DBT intends to achieve:
a)   Electronic transfer of benefits, minimising levels involved in benefit flow
b) 
c)   Accurate targeting of the beneficiary
d)   Curbing pilferage and duplication

 Reduced delay in payments

DBT is an attempt to ensure a better and more timely delivery of benefits directly into the hands 

of the beneficiaries, speeding up payments, removing leakages, and enhancing financial inclusion. 

State Governments should invariably use DBT to provide various kinds of beneficiary oriented 
assistance under SDRF/NDRF like gratuitous relief, assistance to farmers for land/crop loss, assistance 
to  small  and  marginal  farmers  for  replacement  of  animals,  assistance  to  fishermen,  assistance  to 
handicraft/handloom artisans and assistance for houses damaged etc.

The list of beneficiaries will be published in the website of the District Collector and the State 

Government for general information and transparency.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Implementation of drought relief and response measures are initiated following the declaration 
of  drought.  Drought  being  a  complex  phenomenon,  the  response  and  relief  measures,  often 
require sector-specific planning and immense inter-departmental coordination.  It  is  necessary  that 
these  measures  are  undertaken  promptly  and  in  a  planned  manner  for  maximum  impact  in  the 
amelioration of the hardships caused by drought to the farmers and common people. In fact, it is 
strongly suggested that response measures in line with Crisis Management Plan and District Crop 
Contingency Plans ought to get activated as soon as the distress signs become visible, without waiting 
for a formal declaration of drought. However, such measures related to drought relief e.g., remission 
of land revenue and other taxes and dues, deferment and restricting of crop loans, agricultural input 
subsidy etc, can only be set in motion with the formal declaration of drought by the State Government.  
The success and sustainability of these measures depend on a continuous exchange of information 
between the village-levels and the decision-making levels in the State, a responsive administrative 
structure and careful planning. 

This section discusses sector-specific drought relief and response, identifying lead and support 
agencies and detailing the measures that need to be taken. It also includes a section on institutional 
response  and  financing  relief  expenditure.  A  checklist  for  the  Relief  Commissioners  and  District 
Collectors has been provided at the end of this chapter.

Crisis Management Plan

The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare prepares a Crisis Management Plan for drought 
(CMP)  before  the  commencement  of  each  Kharif  season. The  CMP  provides  a  crisis  management 
framework to identify phases of the crisis and the strategic response corresponding to each such 
phase. The plan also provides for a Strategic Activity Planner to act as a ready reckoner for critical 
steps  that  need  to  be  taken  in  different  times  of  the  year  with  respect  to  drought  preparedness, 
drought reporting and drought response, and the agencies responsible for the identified activities. 
Central  Ministries  and  State  Governments  may  seek  guidance  from  the  CMP  to  devise  their  own 
management plans for drought. 

Drought Contingency Planning

District  Agriculture  Contingency  Plans  (DACPs)  have  been  formulated  for  more  than  600 
agriculturally important districts in the country so far by the Central Research Institute for Dryland 
Agriculture (CRIDA) under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare to suggest 
contingency strategies to farmers to cope with major weather related aberrations, including delay 
in onset of south-west monsoon, dry spells etc. CRIDA has prepared these extensive district plans 
covering  crops,  horticulture,  livestock,  poultry  and  fisheries  sectors  in  consultation  with  State 
Agricultural  Universities  and  State  Government  departments  (www.crida.in;http://agricoop.nic.in). 
The State Governments are expected to have contingency plans prepared for drought management 
at sub-district levels (tehsil/block/mandal/taluka).

4.1.   contingency plAnning: prepAredness And 

reAl-time implementAtion 

Lead  Agencies:  State  relief  and  disaster  management  department,  State  departments  of 
Agriculture,  Horticulture,  Irrigation, Watershed  management,  State  Seed  Corporations,  State 
electricity boards, commercial and cooperative banks.
Support Agencies: Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, (Government of India), Indian 
Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), IMD, MNCFC, Department of Land Resources, Ministry 
of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, State Agricultural Universities, 
State Remote Sensing Centres etc. 
Objectives: The objective of a contingency plan is to provide cropping and other options to 
the farmers to help them withstand drought conditions. The recommended measures include 
alternate crop varieties / alternate crops suitable in the event of a delay in onset of monsoon 
rains or dry spell; management options tailored for initial / mid-season / end of season drought 
scenarios in rainfed  / groundwater irrigated / tankfed areas/ canal command areas, both for 
field and horticultural crops.

The DACP recommends contingency measures to cope with drought for rainfed and irrigated 
(groundwater irrigated, tankfed and canal command areas) farming situations on account of delayed 
onset  of  monsoon  (2/4/6/8  weeks  delay)  and  (early/midseason/terminal  drought)  for  field  and 
horticulture  crops. The  contingency  measures  include  alternate  crops  /crop  varieties/  agronomic 
practices/other management options appropriate for drought scenarios. 

The DACP should be updated from time to time to incorporate inputs related to new technological 
advancements and field experiences from scientific institutions (ICAR/SAUs), Ministry of Agriculture 
& Farmers Welfare and other related departments of Central and State Governments, such as Water 
Resources / Irrigation, Animal Husbandry, Rural Development, Drinking Water, Banking, etc, State line 
departments and other stakeholders. There is a need to consider the impact of climate change, the 
advantages to farmers from the adoption of new moisture stress tolerant crop varieties, water saving 
innovations, etc. while updating the plans. 

Preparedness

Careful advance preparation is critical to an effective response and containment of drought.  The 

ambit of preparedness should extend to the following: 

 y
 y

 y

Establishment of a functional DMC at the State Headquarters.
Preparation of Agriculture Contingency Plans for districts and sub-district levels, especially in 
vulnerable districts.
Identification of drought prone areas, preferably at the sub district level.

The contingency plans are to be operationalized  based on assessment of type of drought. 
Choice  of  short  duration  and  less  water-intensive  crops,  unlike  paddy  and  sugarcane, which 
consume  a  lot  of  water. Alternate  crops  such  as  maize, pulses,  groundnut,  sunflower,  soybean, 
fodder and millets can be considered.
Advocacy for  crop  diversification,  mixed  /  inter-cropping  of  main  crop  with  drought tolerant 
companion  crops,  thinning  of  plant  population,  weed  management,  mulching  for  soil 
moisture  conservation,  supplementary  /  protective  irrigation  particularly  with  drip  / 
sprinkler systems.
Contingency  plan  during  the  kharif  season  is  usually  constrained  by uncertainty  of  weather 
behaviour; and lack of lead-time causing logistical problems in organizing delivery of agricultural 
inputs. There is a need to utilize information on the pattern of spatial and temporal variation of 
monsoon to improve the efficacy of contingency crop plans.
It  is  necessary  that  the  decision-makers  get  information  on  the  likely  monsoon behaviour 
even earlier than July to put contingency measures in place. While there are certain risks and 
uncertainties to respond to anomalous weather conditions in July, the confidence level for crop 
planning increases during pre-rabi and more certainly during rabi  seasons.  Better  information 
on  the  extent  of  soil  moisture,  reservoir  water and ground water levels  can  help  the  State 
Governments in issuing advisories for crop planning.

4.1.1.  Near Real-Time Implementation of Contingency Plans
Implementation

While some of the preparedness measures such as management practices particularly in-situ soil 
conservation, tank silt application, conservation tillage, conservation agriculture measures help in 
overcoming dry spells, a scenario may still arise on account of long dry spells or sensitiveness of crop 
which may warrant intervention by line departments. 

The real-time contingency measures aim to (i) establish a crop with optimum plant population 
during  the  delayed  onset  of  monsoon;  (ii)  ensure  better  performance  of  crops  during  seasonal 
drought  (early/mid  and  terminal  drought)  and  extreme  events,  enhance  performance,  improve 
productivity and income; (iii) minimize damage to horticultural crops/produce; (iv) minimize physical 
damage to livestock, poultry and fisheries sector and ensure better  performance to ensure food 
security at village level and (v) enhance the adaptive capacity and livelihoods of the farmers.

The States are required to prepare agro-advisory bulletins in response to weather forecasts in 
consultation with State agricultural / horticulture / veterinary Universities and other NARS partners 
for the use of farmers. 

States are advised to install, collect, analyze and utilize the rainfall information from sub district 

levels i.e., Tehsils / blocks / mandals etc. in order to address the issues of drought realistically.

To ensure successful implementation of DACPs, following support systems need to be put in 

place.

    The  States  are  advised  to  prepare  agro-advisory  bulletins  based  on  crop  contingency 
plans  and  widely disseminate  them  among  farmers  in  drought-affected  region. The district agro-

53

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

advisory bulletins issued by IMD (www.imdagrimet.gov.in; www.farmer.gov.in; www.mkisan.gov.in) 
under Gramin Krishi Mausam Seva project may also be consulted while preparing their agro-advisory 
bulletins. 

Some of the methods/measures to be adopted as near real-time contingency plan implementation 
during  various  weather  aberrations  are  given  in  some  near-real  time  methods/measures  to  be 
adopted to cope with delayed onset of monsoon and seasonal drought  are described below.

Delayed onset of monsoon

In rainfed areas, as a general rule early sowing of crops with the onset of monsoon is the best-
bet practice that gives higher realizable yield. Major crops affected due to monsoon delays are those 
crops that have a narrow sowing window and therefore cannot be taken up if the delay is beyond this 
cut-off date. Crops with wider sowing windows can still be taken up till the cut-off date without major 
yield loss and only the change warranted could be the choice of short duration cultivars. Beyond the 
sowing window, choice of alternate crops or cultivars depends on the farming situation, soil, rainfall 
and cropping pattern in the location and extent of delay in the onset of monsoon.

Early season drought

Early season drought may at times result in seedling mortality needing re-sowing or may result 
in poor crop stand and seedling growth. Further, the duration of water availability for crop growth 
gets reduced due to the delayed start, and the crops suffer from an acute shortage of water during 
reproductive stage due to early withdrawal of monsoon. The effect of early season drought is less on 
the crop, because during this period sowing is carried out. Various operations carried out are primary 
tillage, sowing, fertilizer application and intercultural operations. Other agronomic measures include 
resowing within a week to 10 days with subsequent rains for better plant stand when germination is 
less than 30%, thinning in small-seeded crops, interculture to break soil crust and remove weeds and 
create soil mulch for conserving soil moisture, avoiding top dressing of fertilizers till favourable soil 
moisture, opening conservation furrows at 10 to 15 m intervals, ridge and furrow across the slope for 
effective moisture conservation as well as in rainwater in wide spaced crops (>30 cm), pot watering 
may be taken up along with gap filling when the crop stand is less than 75% in crops like cotton, foliar 
spray of 2% urea during prolonged dry spells wherever ground/ surface water is available.

Mid-season drought

Stunted  growth  takes  place  if  mid-season  drought  occurs  at  vegetative  phase.  If  it  occurs  at 
flowering or early reproductive stage, it will have an adverse effect on the ultimate crop yield. In-situ 
soil-moisture conservation is a vital component of dryland crop management practices. During mid 
season drought plant protection, top-dressing of fertilizer, intercultural and supplemental irrigation 
are the usual practices. In case of long dry spells, crop based production system (location) related 
specific contingency plans are needed. Other agronomic measures include repeated interculture to 
remove weeds and create soil mulch to conserve soil moisture, thinning, avoiding top-dressing of 
fertilizers until receipt of rains, opening conservation furrows for moisture conservation, foliar spray 
of 2% KNO3 or 2% urea solution or 1% water soluble fertilizers like 19-19-19, 20-20-20, 21-21-21 to 
supplement nutrition during dry spells, open alternate furrows, surface mulching with crop residues, 
providing supplemental irrigation (10 cm depth), if available.

54

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Terminal drought

If there is a terminal drought, crop-management strategies like plant protection, soil and water 
conservation,  interculture,  supplemental  irrigation  and  harvesting  are  to  be  adopted.  Terminal 
droughts  are  more  critical  as  the  grain  yield  is  strongly  related  to  water  availability  during  the 
reproductive  stage.  Further,  these  conditions  are  often  associated  with  an  increase  in  ambient 
temperatures leading to forced maturity. The agronomic measure include providing life- saving or 
supplemental irrigation, if available, from harvested pond water or other sources, harvesting crop at 
physiological maturity with some realizable yield or harvest for fodder and prepare for winter (rabi) 
sowing  in  double-  cropped  areas.  Ratoon  maize  or  pearl  millet  or  adopt  relay  crops  as  chickpea, 
safflower, rabi sorghum and sunflower with minimum tillage after soybean in medium to deep black 
soils in Maharashtra or take up contingency crops (horsegram/cowpea) or dual-purpose forage crops 
on receipt of showers under receding soil moisture conditions.

4.1.2. Implementation of DACPs

The implementation of DACPs would require the following support systems.

Seed Banks 

challenge. 

During drought, the availability of seeds of appropriate varieties in sufficient quantities is a major 

To ensure availability of the desired seed at the time of drought, a plan for production or sourcing 
of desirable seed varieties needs to be implemented well in advance. A Consortium Approach for 
production,  supply  and  timely  availability  of  the  seed  to  the  farmers  is  advocated  with  sufficient 
guarantees  from  the  State  Government  for  procurement  of  the  available  contingent  seed.  Seed 
Banks can be set up at the most strategically advantageous locations for which adequate financial 
provisions will be called for. 

Livestock  component  is  critical  for  ensuring  livelihoods  particularly  in  arid  regions  during 
drought years. Fodder Banks need to be established at strategic locations using improved fodder/
feed storage methods for supply of fodder to deficit areas. Community lands may be identified for 
fodder production. 

Fodder Banks 

Nutrient Banks  

The concept of Nutrient Bank is being evolved wherein stocks of essential manures and fertilizers, 
soil amendments, foliar spray chemicals; bio-fertilizers etc. are maintained locally and made available 
to  the  local  community  to  help  timely  sowing  even  when  the  sowing  window  is  limited.  These 
nutrient banks can be managed by SHGs in conjunction with Gram Panchayats. Farmers can approach 
nutrient bank to avail foliar sprays like KNO3 spray, which enhances drought tolerance. 

Custom Hiring Centre (CHC)

Custom hiring centres for farm machinery at village level are likely to enhance availability of 
implements  at  low  cost,  to  help  in  zero  tillage,  improved  seed  and  fertilizer  application,  in  situ 

55

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

moisture conservation practices, water lifting with energy efficient pumps  and efficient application 
(through  micro  irrigation  systems),  foliar  sprays,  harvesting  of  crops,  residue  incorporation,  relay 
cropping etc. even to small farmers on a real time contingency basis.

Support  to  Farmers 

Farmers  require  prompt  government  support  in  the  form  of  inputs,  credit  and  extension 

services on a proactive basis. 
 y Agriculture  Input  Support:  Farmers  in  drought-affected  areas  need  to  be  provided  with 

 y
 y

subsidized seeds of appropriate varieties to help with the second sowing.
Energy Support: Farmers need to be provided assured quality power supply for irrigation. 
Extension  Support:  The  State  department  of  agriculture  through  its  various  bodies 
including ATMA (Agricultural Technology Management Agency)  and  agricultural universities 
should  provide  extension  services  related  to  advice  on  crop  varieties,  selection  of  seeds, 
soil  and  water  conservation  measures,  contingency  crops  and  agronomic  practices.  State 
Governments could also use the Kisan Call Centres (KCCs) and M-Kisan portal of DAC&FW for 
communicating audio/text messages and advisories to farmers. Audio conferencing of experts 
with the farmers registered with KCCs and M-kisan portal also could be considered. The State 
Governments could consider training the Farm Tele Advisors of KCCs so as to enable them to 
render proper advices and suggestions to the farmers in the Drought affected areas.

56

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

relief employment

Objectives:  The  most  important  relief  component  during  the  drought  period  is  the  generation  of 
employment.  Due  to  drought,  agricultural  operations  are  reduced  substantially,  restricting  the  scope 
for  gaining  employment.  People  look  for  alternative  employment,  or  migrate  elsewhere  in  search  of 
employment.  As  soon  as  drought  is  declared,  it  is,  therefore,  necessary  for  the  State  Governments  to 
immediately start relief employment programmes and provide work to those who need employment  in 
the vicinity. Income generation through these employment works helps participating workers to meet 
their basic needs.

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)

Implemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development,  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural 
Employment  Guarantee  Act  (Mahatma  Gandhi  NREGA),  2005  provides  the  legal  framework  for 
the flagship programme of the Government that directly touches lives of the poor and promotes 
inclusive growth. The Act aims at enhancing livelihood security of households in rural areas of the 
country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year 
to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is one of the largest 
and most ambitious social security and public works programmes in the world. The primary objective 
is  augmenting  wage  employment.      The  other  main  objective  is  strengthening  natural  resource 
management through works that address causes of chronic poverty like drought, deforestation and 
soil erosion and so encourage sustainable development.  The scheme is a significant step towards 
strengthening grass-root processes of democracy and infusing transparency and accountability in 
governance.

The Act came into force on February 2, 2006 and was implemented in a phased manner. In Phase 
I it was introduced in 200 of the most backward districts of the country. It was implemented in an 
additional 130 districts in Phase II (2007-2008). In Phase III the Act was notified in the remaining rural 
districts of India from April 1, 2008.

Demand for work
1.  Registering demand for work is central to the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. The 
Program Officer and the Programme Implementing Agencies (PIA) must ensure that the process 
of submission of applications for work must be kept open on a continuous basis. 

2.  The implementing agencies must ensure that workers in need of employment under Mahatma 
Gandhi NREGA are provided work within 15 days of the receipt of the application or the date of 
demand,  in  case  of  advance  application,  whichever  is  later,  as  mandated  by  the  Act.  Program 
Officer and implementing agencies must ensure that work is provided on demand within 15 days.

3.  The mandate of the Act is to provide at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to 
every rural household whose adult member volunteers to do unskilled manual work. The Ministry 
mandates the provision of additional 50 days of wage employment (beyond the stipulated 100 
days) per Scheduled Tribe Household in a forest area, provided that these households have no 
other private property except for the land rights provided under the FRA Act 2006. 

4. 

In  exercise  of  the  provisions  under  Section  3  (4)  of  Mahatma  Gandhi  NREGA,  the  Central 
Government decides to provide an additional 50 days of unskilled manual work in a financial 
year, over and above the 100 days assured to job card holders in such rural areas where drought 
or natural calamities (as defined by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India from time 
to  time)  have  been  notified. The  notification  is  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development 
based on the notification of the State Government to this effect and as recommended by the 
Department of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers Welfare.

Other Employment Generating Schemes

The State Relief  Commissioners need  to prepare plans, in  consultation with line departments 
responsible for labour-intensive works, for providing relief employment to the people especially in 
chronically  susceptible  regions. The  Relief  Commissioner  must  prepare  a financial  plan  for meeting 
the expenditure incurred on relief employment in close coordination with the Rural Development 
Department and the district administration.

In a drought situation, the volume of demand for rural employment is likely to see a significant 
spike and therefore it is necessary for the State Government to bring about convergence of all schemes 
and  programmes  of  the  Centre  and  States  which  have  a  potential  for  employment  generation,  such 

58

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna, Local  Area  Development  Schemes  for  the  Members  of 
Parliament (MPLADS) and Members of State Legislature (MLALADS)etc. 

The departments responsible for the implementation of this programme need to start public 
works  in  drought-affected  areas  to  maximize  employment.  The  State  Government  may  take 
necessary steps to encourage increased workers’ participation in these programmes. 

MPLADS and MLALADS have the potential to generate relief employment. Further, large-scale 

employment can be generated through works like canal excavation etc. 

The State Governments need to issue a detailed set of guidelines and directives to the  district 
administration  for  commencing  relief  employment  programmes.  The  district  administration 
needs  to  be  given  authority  and  flexibility  within  the  framework  of  these  guidelines  for 
implementing relief employment programmes.

At the district level, Collectors of drought-affected district are required to prepare  district plans 
for relief employment, specifying the types and number of works to be taken in different pockets of 
the district and the total employment these works would generate.

The district administration must provide employment to people as soon as there is a demand 
for employment with minimum delay. While planning, it is necessary that people  get  employment 
within 1.5–5 kilometers of their residence.

The  Collector  should  direct  all  technical  departments  to  identify  feasible  works  (preferably 
as  per  the  needs  of  the  local  community)  in  all  the  drought-affected  villages  and  prepare 
estimates for these works and provide technical  sanction  to  these  works. The  Collector  should 
prepare  such  a  plan  in consultation with all the technical departments and provide administrative 
and financial approval for all the works included in the plan.

The  district  administration  needs  to  maintain  an  extensive  shelf  of  projects  for  execution  in  a 
drought situation. All line departments need to be in readiness for starting these works. They need 
to reassign their staff and keep the equipments in readiness for starting these works. Where tools 
and equipment are not adequate for starting these works, the line  departments  need  to  procure 
them, with a defined responsibility for their safe storage.

The Collector must conduct regular meetings of all the technical departments responsible for 
implementing relief employment programmes. The works in progress, attendance  on  these  works, 
administrative and technical issues, wage payment and release  of  food grains  to  the  workers  are 
issues that need to  be reviewed in these meetings.

The Collectors should  be authorized to  redeploy technical and  administrative staff within  the 
district for implementing and supervising these works in consultation with regional heads of these 
departments. In such instances, where the relief works have started on a large-scale, the Collectors 
can  request  the  State  Government  to  post  additional  officers  on  a  temporary  basis.  Collectors 
can  be  authorized  to  hire  vehicles,  provide  daily  allowance  and  get  administrative  support 
for facilitating the implementation  and  supervision  of  relief  works. The  Collectors  need  to 
invoke disciplinary powers for proceeding against officers found to be in dereliction of their duties.

In  the  course  of  implementing  relief  employment  programmes,  priority  needs  to be given to 
water conservation, water harvesting works (such as check dams, gabion structures, percolation tanks), 

59

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

and minor irrigation works (such as tanks and farm ponds, canal excavation, community wells, nalla 
bunding, afforestation). These works are useful for enhancing the availability of water and agricultural 
production.  Desilting  and  cleaning  of  canals,  which  is  overdue  on  account  of  non-availability  of 
resources for many years, is also helpful in supplying of water to the tail-end users. For each State, 
these  priorities  may  change  as  per  the  local  situation.  A  discussion  on  the importance of these 
individual works for drought mitigation has been provided in the section on drought mitigation.

Along  with  the  public  works,  it  would  be  useful  to  undertake  individual  beneficiary  oriented 

works to help as it create durable assets and enhance sources of income. These include:

Farm ponds / percolation tanks

 y
 y New wells / deepening of wells / recharging of wells
 y Horticulture / agro-forestry
 y
 y

Construction of new water channels / rain harvesting structures
Sanitation latrines
The State Government should lay down the criteria for the selection of beneficiaries for taking up 
these individual beneficiary works. While sanctioning these works, technical and financial norms 
need to be fixed. For the payment of wages, the muster roll must be maintained.

In  the  tribal  and  hilly  areas,  the  local  conditions  may  not  be  conducive  for  large-  scale 
employment.  In  such  a  situation,  individual  beneficiary  works  for  tribals  should  be  taken  up.  It 
should involve land development, plantations and afforestation, water conservation programmes, 
grass cutting and storage, construction of new farm ponds and wells and rural houses.

It is necessary that spill-over works taken in the previous years as drought relief works be taken 
up first. Works that can be completed or brought to a safe stage, can be next on the priority list. New 
works can be taken only where the spill-over plan works are not available. Only after these works 
are completed, should new works be taken up. A  new  work  can  be  taken  up  for  execution  only 
after  all  preliminary  steps,  such  as preparation of plans and estimates and technical sanction and 
administrative approval of the appropriate authority, are completed.

Collectors must report to the State Government of the number of works, the total attendance of 

workers, the total wages paid and the distribution of foodgrains on a weekly basis.

In the drought-affected areas, Gram Sabhas need to be convened in all the Gram Panchayats 
for  discussing  the  drought  situation.  In  the  Gram  Sabha,  water  use  management,  relief 
employment works, payment of wages, and provision of foodgrains need  to  be  on  the  agenda  for 
deliberations. Gram Sabhas can become an effective forum for conducting a social audit of drought 
relief operations and need to be held once a month.

While  the  district  administration  must  strive  to  provide  employment  to  all  the able-bodied 
adult,  men  and  women  and  there  cannot  be  any  discrimination  in  the provision of relief, special 
attention needs to be focused on “below poverty line” families, landless labourers, Scheduled Caste 
and Scheduled Tribe households. 

60

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Each worker should be issued a job card, which would help in closely monitoring the attendance 
on  works, payment  of  wages  and  amount  of  foodgrains  to  each  worker. The  job  card  should  be 
available to the Inspecting Officers at work sites. Under the MGNREGA, all participating families are 
given job cards. These job cards need to be extended to other relief employment programmes also.

Wages must be paid to the workers in accordance with the norms laid down for the MGNREGS 

guidelines.  

Information on the number of people provided with relief employment under each scheme 
should be provided in the form prescribed for individual schemes such as the MGNREGS. However, 
information on the demand and supply of the wage employment and migration etc. 
can be submitted in Form No. 9 included in the Annexure 1.

wAter  resources  mAnAgement

Objectives: Water resource management in the drought-affected areas is one of the most critical tasks of 
relief operations. Since water is a basic need for human and cattle population, assured supply of drinking 
water is the most important responsibility for the Government at all levels. It requires diverse measures 
such as augmentation of water supply, rationing of water use, and efficient utilization and management 
of water resources, in both urban and rural areas. Provision of water and its use is the most important 
yardstick for judging the effectiveness of relief operations.
 
Water  scarcity  is  expected  to  manifest  during  events  of  hydrological  drought.  Successive  years  of 
hydrological drought will enhance the scarcity. 

To  assess  sector-wise  demand  and  availability  of  water  resources,  possible  shortages  in  meeting  the 
demand and evolving strategy to work on the shortages, if any. 

Lead Agencies: State  Government  departments  of  water  supply,  Irrigation,  rural  development,  public 
health engineering, and relief, as well as the district administration.

Support  Agencies:  Ministry  of  Drinking  Water  and  Sanitation,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  RD  &GR; 
Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India; Central Water Commission, Central Ground Water 
Board,  Railways,  State  Government  groundwater  survey  and  development  agency,  Irrigation,  Drinking 
water and watershed development departments.

Storage levels of water in surface water bodies and in ground water reservoirs and aquifers tend 
to get impacted in the event of hydrological drought and as such areas with high rainfall may not 
be immune to severe scarcity of water. Shortage of water is one of the earliest indicators of drought 
and therefore, a realistic assessment of  demand  for  water,  its total availability and management of 
supply is extremely important in the management of drought.

Provision of  Water

The  first  step  in  water  resource  management  is  estimation  of  the  availability  and  demand 
for  water from the Gram Panchayat upto the district level  on  the  basis  of  the  consumption  needs  for 
drinking, agriculture, industry etc. All follow up measures aimed at conservation, augmentation 
and sector-wise prioritization of water supply emerges from an accurate estimation of 
demand and availability. 

Following measures are proposed for managing the water resources in a drought-affected 

area:

Reservoir Management
 y

The  State  Government  is  advised  to  enunciate  the  policy  for  laying  down  the  priorities 
for use of reservoir storage for drinking, irrigation, industry, power plants, recreation, and other 
commercial uses. 

62

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

 y

In keeping with the State policy, in a drought situation, it is the Collector who undertakes reservoir 
management with the help and support of the irrigation / water resources department and Zilla 
Panchayat. The irrigation / water resources department and / or Zilla Panchayat provide relevant 
information to  the  Collector  in  respect  to  storage  of  water  in  reservoirs  and  enforce  his 
instructions regarding its distribution and use. The  Collector  must  determine  the  quantity  of 
water  that  is  required  to  be  reserved  for  drinking  water  purposes,  and  intimate the  same  to 
the concerned water supply / irrigation authorities. The Collector’s order for water reservation 
for  the  purpose  of  drinking  should  be  binding  upon  the  water  supply  /irrigation  authorities. 
Appropriate decision on the allocation of quantities and timing of release of the balance water 
for other purposes will be taken by the Collector. 

 y Water required to be supplied to a village or town for the purpose of drinking water should, 
as  far  as  possible,  be  taken  from  the  reservoir  and  conveyed  to  the village  or  town  through 
a  pipeline.  Only  in  exceptional  circumstances,  such  as where the village or town is situated 
within a short distance from the reservoir, the water could be released in the river.
In  case  situation  demands,  the  domestic  water  supply  needs  to  be  arranged  through 
transportation by road or railway.

 y

Repairs and Augmentation of Existing Water Supply Schemes
 y

The State Government should issue special orders for repairs of pipelines, electric-pumps, hand-
pumps dug wells etc, and augmentation of all  existing  water  supply  schemes well before the 
monsoon season. 

 y

 y Departments of water supply, public health engineering and rural development and Panchayat 
Raj will cooperate with the Collector in carrying out repair and augmentation work of drinking 
water supply schemes and provide all necessary information regarding water supply. 
The Collector needs to prepare a Taluka-wise list of all the water supply schemes in the district 
which need repairs.  The Collector can accordingly prepare a contingency plan, in consultation 
with the technical agencies and local bodies, on the basis of availability of mechanical supervisors, 
mechanics and electricians and inventory of spare parts and accessories. Mobile vans with hand 
pump mechanics carrying spare parts, tools and tackles may be deployed in the Gram Panchayats 
to ensure on the spot repair of reported hand pumps and restoration without unnecessary delay. 
In those cases, where technically qualified people are not available with the Government agencies, 
they could be employed on a contractual basis at the Taluka or village level. While preparing such 
contingency plans, special attention should be paid to susceptible areas in the district. 
At the village level, it should be the duty of the Sarpanch or Gram Sevak, or any other functionary 
appointed for this purpose, to promptly report to the Tehsildar and Block Development Officer 
when any hand pump or power pump goes out of order. The Tehsildar and Block Development 
Officer, with the assistance of engineers of  the  relevant  departments,  should  ensure  that  the 
hand  pump  or  the  electrical pump  fitted  on  a  bore-well  is  immediately  repaired with the 
assistance  of  the  line  department.  In  many  cases  where  the  repairs  needed  are  major,  a 
mobile repairs unit can be sent for carrying out the necessary repairs.

 y

 y When  drought  is  declared,  a  district-level  campaign  should  be  organized  for repairing  all 
the hand pumps and electricity /  pumps fitted on bore-wells. The campaign would be more 
effective if it is supported by indenting in spare parts and accessories required for carrying out 

63

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

necessary repairs  in advance.  For  each  hand  pump  and  bore-well,  a  card  can  be  maintained 
which records the visits of mechanics and electricians and the details of repairs that have been 
carried out.
The village Panchayat has the overall responsibility for proper maintenance and timely repairs 
of  the  piped  water  supply. However, in  a drought  situation,  village  Panchayats  can  be  given 
suitable  grants  by  the  district administration  for  meeting  the  expenditure  on  maintenance 
and repairs of the water supplies.
The Collector should be provided funds for immediate repairs to water supply schemes, hand 
pumps, solar pumps and bore-wells through the SDRF/departmental schemes. These funds can 
be placed with the technical agencies for undertaking necessary repairs to  these  water  supply 
schemes.
The  drinking  water  bore  wells  /  tube  wells  need  to  be  assessed  periodically  for  their  aquifer 
efficiency, well efficiency, conveyance and distribution efficiency.

 y

 y

 y

 y Water conservation measures to be taken up on top priority. In case of successive droughts, the 
ground water resources should be assessed and considered for exclusive use in the supply of 
drinking water. In such circumstances, the closing of sluice gates of minors / major irrigation 
tanks and conservation of water for human and livestock consumption ought to be given priority.

Special Measures and Schemes for Areas with Drinking Water Scarcity
 y With the earliest signs of a hydrological drought,  the  Collector  should  direct  the  Tehsildars 
and Block  Development  Officers  to  visit  the  affected  areas  and  draw  up Taluka-wise lists of 
villages in which drinking water scarcity has already developed, or likely to arise. Such visits will 
always be undertaken with the engineers and officials of water supply, public health engineering, 
or rural development department, as the case may be. Such lists should be developed with maps 
indicating the location of villages,  routes  linking  these  villages  and  existing  sources  of  water 
supply in these villages, such as piped water supply, bore-wells, or dug wells.
The  Collector  would  get  the  list  of  these  problem  villages  counterchecked  through  the Sub-
Divisional Officers and other district officers from the relevant departments. The Collector should 
also personally visit 5–10% of the villages for verifying the factual position related to availability 
of  drinking  water. The  Collector  should  then  finalize  the  list  in  consultation  with  the  officials 
dealing with water supply and the State ground water survey and development agency.

 y

 y

 y On the basis of this information, the Collector should prepare a contingency plan for provision 
of  drinking  water  in  all  the  villages  that  are  likely  to  face  a  water scarcity. The contingency 
plan should lay down the priority for provision of drinking water as follows:
Any  piped  water  supply  scheme,  which  is  already  under  execution  in  any  of  these  villages, 
should be completed expeditiously;
Piped  water  supply,  temporary  piped  water  supply,  or  bore-wells  already constructed 
in  any  of  the  villages  which  are  non-functional  should  be  made functional by undertaking 
necessary repairs or renovation;
The  maintenance work of  hand  pumps  or  electrical  pumps  fitted  on bore-wells in the village 
should be completed on top priority. If an existing bore-well can provide enough water to the 
village by installation of a power pump, then the district administration should take emergent 

 y

 y

64

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

measures to get the power pump installed;
The feasibility of a new bore-well in the village should be assessed with the help of State ground 
water survey and development agency. Where feasible, a programme installing  new  bore-wells 
could be taken up. Care should be taken to avoid deep bore-wells as they damage aquifers.
If any of the above mentioned measures are not feasible, emergent measures such as desilting, 
deepening,  or  blasting  of  existing  wells,  or  construction  of  open  wells  in  river  beds  can  be 
undertaken, as suggested in the section on Other Emergency Measures for Supply of Drinking 
Water.
If  the  district  administration  assesses  that  these  sources  of  water  would  not  be sufficient to 
meet the drinking water needs of a village, they can arrange to provide drinking  water  through 
tankers  or  bullock  carts,  as  suggested  in  the  section  on Supply of Water through Tankers and 
Bullock Carts.

Construction of Temporary Piped Water Supply
 y

The State Government should decide to construct temporary piped water supply in a village, if 
the following conditions are fulfilled:
  No source of drinking water supply is available or is likely to be available within a distance 

of 0.5 kilometre of the village;

  No  possibility  of  constructing  a  new  bore-well  at  the  village  or  within  a  distance  of  one 
kilometre  of  the  village  or  to  undertake  further  drilling  in  the  existing  bore-well  at  the 
village, due to non-availability of groundwater source at the village;

  Where,  water  supply  at  the  rate  of  40  litres  per  day  per  head would be available at  the 

source for the projected human and livestock population of the village;

  Where the supply is based on a private source of water, e.g. a private well, it is ensured that 

the source is adequate to last till the scarcity abates;

The Collector should fix the agency for commissioning temporary water supply in consultation 
with  the  department  of  water  supply,  public  health  engineering,  or  rural  development 
department, as the case may be. It could either be implemented by the agency responsible for 
water supply in the State or a local body.
Each State Government should delegate powers of technical and administrative approval of 
the temporary water supply schemes to authorities.

Construction of Bore-wells
 y

A bore-well programme can be taken up in a village, which is facing or is likely to face drinking 
water scarcity, if it is technically feasible to construct bore-wells at such a village. Sites for bore-
wells can be selected on the basis of recommendations made by the State ground water survey 
and development agency.
Bore-wells with a hand pump fitted thereon can be set up for a population of 250. 
If the population exceeds 250, more than one bore-well can be installed to serve the village.
The Collector can request the departments of water supply, public health engineering, or 
rural development department, as the case may be, to deploy drilling machines for installing 

 y

 y

 y

65

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

bore-wells. Where it is necessary to obtain additional drilling machines, these can be obtained on 
hire from private owners.

 y When a village has power supply, for a population of at least 500 one or more bore- wells having 
high yield power pumps may be installed only on one such bore-well for solving the problem of 
drinking water in the village.

 y When a bore-well programme is undertaken in a village, it is necessary to take into account the 
cattle population of the village. Along with bore-wells, it would be necessary to provide water 
taps and troughs for the cattle.

Other Emergency Measures for Supply of Drinking Water
 y

The  Collector  should  undertake  emergency  measures  such  as  de-silting  or  deepening 
of  existing  public  wells  to  increase  the  availability  of  water. Other measures such as in-well 
drilling, blasting and revitalization can also be attempted for augmenting the capacity of these 
wells. These measures need to be planned with  the  support  of  departments  of  water  supply, 
public health engineering, or rural development department, as the case may be,

 y Where  no  public  well  is  available  or  is  likely  to  be  successful  after  taking  such measures, 
the Collector may authorize and make available a private well on rent, if the owner of the well 
agrees to allow public consumption with no discrimination against any caste, creed or religion. 
In  all  the  cases  where  a  private  well  is  being brought under use, the Collector should fix the 
rent for drawing drinking water and make the payment to the owner of the well and also make 
an announcement to this effect so that the owners of private wells come forward to offer their 
wells for supply of drinking water at a rent fixed by the district administration.

 y Old wells that have fallen into disuse should be repaired for ensuring drinking water supply to the 
villagers if the State ground water survey and development agency certifies that after carrying 
out the necessary repairs the well would provide adequate water supply. Before these old wells 
are used for drawing drinking water, it should be ensured that water is properly chlorinated, and 
a certificate obtained from the State health department stating that the water is fit for human 
consumption.

 y Where the water in a river or stream gets scarce, holes could be dug in the beds of the  stream 
or  river. Where  water  has  been  impounded  by  putting  a  temporary bund, such holes could 
preferably be dug on the banks near the impounded water and the water is reserved in those 
holes for drinking purposes. This would provide practically filtered water to the villagers for the 
purpose of drinking.

 y Where the water has sunk much below the bed, it may be necessary to sink concrete pipes in the 
holes  dug  in  the  bed  so  that  water  gets  collected  in  the  pipes  and could then be used  for 
drinking water purposes.

 y When  a  certain  area  faces  acute  drinking  water  scarcity,  it  may  become  necessary  to  save 
and  preserve  water,  particularly  from  small  and  shallow  tanks,  for  drinking  water  purposes 
by  controlling  evaporation  losses.  Certain  chemicals  can  be  spread  over  surfaces  of  water 
storages, which would control evaporation. However, such a measure needs to be undertaken in 
consultation with the State health department. The district administration would be responsible 
for ensuring that chemicals used for controlling evaporation are safe and would not cause any 
health hazard to the people consuming such water.

66

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

 y

The  details  of  expenditure  on  installation,  augmentation  and  repairs  to  all  water  supply 
schemes and sources can be provided in Form No. 8, included in Annex 1.

Supply of Water through Tankers and Bullock Carts
 y

The Collector  should  take  the  decision to  supply  water  through  tankers or  bullock carts  to  a 
village or town in the drought-affected area, where no other source of water supply is available. 
The  Collector  should  decide  after  obtaining  reports  from Taluka  /  Block-level  officials,  which 
are counterchecked by Sub-divisional Officers. In such cases too, the Collector should decide to 
supply water by a tanker or bullock cart, where a permanent or temporary water supply system 
is under repairs, till the time these repairs are completed.

 y

 y

 y While  making  the  survey  of  villages  for  supply  of  water  through  tankers  or  bullock  carts,  it 
shall  be  obligatory  for  the  departments  of  water  supply, public  health engineering  or  rural 
development department, as the case may be, to provide necessary technical, administrative 
and logistical help.
The State Government should issue orders, authorizing the Collector to requisition Government 
tankers from all the departments for the supply of drinking water. It would be the responsibility 
of all the departments to provide tankers along with the services of a driver when the Collector 
makes a demand.
If any of the tankers are in disrepair, it should be the responsibility of the officers of the concerned 
department  to  undertake  necessary  repairs  to  the  tanker  before making  it  available  to  the 
Collector.
The Collector would first deploy Government tankers for the supply of drinking water.
Private  tankers  can  be  hired  only  when  Government  tankers  are  not  available  or inadequate 
for  ensuring  uninterrupted  supply  of  drinking  water  to  the  affected  villages. The  Collector 
should  hire  these  vehicles  by  inviting  tenders  and  fixing  the rate  for  trips  involving  different 
distances. The  Collector  should  issue  instructions for  the  maintenance  of  logbooks  of  these 
vehicles, as payment to the owners of these tankers is to be made on the basis of entries in these 
logbooks.The operations of  these  tankers  need  to  be  regulated  carefully. The  Collector  should 
discontinue the  deployment  of  tankers  immediately  after  local  sources  of  water  have  been 
recharged or re-developed.

 y
 y

 y

 y Where  water  supply  is  being  arranged  through  tankers  or  bullock  carts,  the Government 
should consider providing big storage tanks in villages or towns with a capacity of more than 
5,000 litres, so that water wastage is minimized.
In  villages  where  roads  are  not  motorable,  it  may  be  more  convenient  and economical 
to  engage  bullock  carts  for  supplying  water. The  Collector  should  hire  local  bullock  carts  for 
supplying water. In all such cases, the Collector should fix the number  of  trips  to  be  made  by 
bullock carts and pay per trip to the bullock cart owner.
In  extra  ordinary  drought  situation  the  drinking  water  requirement  may  also  be  arranged 
through Railways.
Information on supply of drinking water through tankers and bullock carts can be provided in 
Form No. 7, included in Annexure 1.

food security

Lead Agencies:  State  Government  Departments  of  Food  and  Civil  Supplies  and  the  District 
Administration.  
Support  Agencies:  Ministry  of  Consumer  Affairs,  Food  and  Public  Distribution,  Food 
Corporation of India, Indian Railways, State Government Departments of Women and Child, 
and School Education.  
Objective: To ensure provision of adequate food and nutrition to the population in drought 
affected areas.  

Provision of Food
1.  For food security of the people, Government is implementing the National Food Security Act, 
2013 (NFSA) which provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural population and upto 50% of the 
urban population at the national level for receiving subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public 
Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the population. Corresponding to 
the above coverage of the all India level, State/UT-wise coverage was determined by the then 
Planning Commission.  Coverage for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under the Act has 
been delinked from poverty estimates and is substantially above the percentage of population 
living below the poverty line.

2.  Main responsibility for implementation of NFSA, which inter alia includes identification of eligible 
households, issuing ration cards to them, ensuring delivery of foodgrains upto door-steps of fair 
price shops and its timely distribution to eligible households lies with States/UTs and therefore 
ensuring food security in the drought-affected areas requires the following actions to be taken 
by the State/UT department of civil supplies:

 y

 y

 y

 y

 y

 y

Special drive should be launched to ensure that no deserving and eligible household is left out 
of coverage under NFSA.
In case ration card has not been issued to some deserving and eligible households, supply of 
subsidized foodgrains to that household should be started on the basis of some other identity 
proof prescribed by the State Government, till ration card is issued.
  In  case,  names  of  some  members  of  eligible  households  are  missing  from  the  ration  card, 
immediate steps must be taken for rectification. 
The State Government/UT Admn./Collector of the drought affected area must ensure that Fair 
Price Shops are distributing foodgrains to the people in the drought-affected areas. There should 
be necessary vigilance against any diversion of foodgrains or its mis-utilization. 
In  those  places,  where  Fair  Price  Shops  are  not  available,  new  ones  for  the  distribution  of 
foodgrains can be started through self-help groups or cooperatives or even village Panchayats. 
In remote and difficult to reach areas, mobile Fair Price Shops can be arranged. The schedule of 
movement of these mobile shops can be fixed and publicized. 

68

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

 y

 y

Inspection of warehouses and Fair Price Shops should be intensified during the drought period, 
to ensure availability of foodgrains and its effective distribution.
The  State  Government/UT  Admn./Collector  of  the  drought  affected  area  should  exercise 
surveillance over prices of essential commodities. If the local prices of foodgrains increase, the 
Collector should bring it to the notice of the State/UT Government. 

 y Wherever  required,  the  State  Government/UT  Admn./Collector  of  the  drought  affected  area 
should take steps to prevent hoarding of essential commodities, prevent manipulation in prices 
through creation of artificial scarcities and ensure availability of essential commodities in the 
market. 

3.  State  Government/UT  Administration  should  make  assessment  of  requirement  of  additional 
foodgrains, if any, over and above the NFSA allocation, to deal with special situation arising due 
to  drought,  and  request  the  Government  of  India  for  additional  allocation,  which  shall  make 
necessary allocation as per the then prevailing policy.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

nutrition Aspects of food security

The State Government should address the nutritional aspects of food security through schemes 
such as the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and Mid-day Meals. The ICDS is implemented 
for pre-school children, while mid-day meal has been introduced for school-going children.

Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)

The ICDS scheme was initiated in 1975 to improve the health and nutritional status of children 
in  the  0–6  age-group  by  providing  supplementary  food  and  coordinating  with  State  health 
departments to ensure the delivery of the required health inputs. It also provides food supplements 
to pregnant and lactating women. The type of food supplements  in  the  ICDS  programme  varies 
widely, from  ready-to-eat  food  to  the supply of supplements cooked in Aanganwadis.

The  ICDS  programme  is  centrally  sponsored. The  centre  bears  the  cost  of maintaining 

the infrastructure, while the  State bears the expenditure on  the food component. 

In a drought situation, the ICDS can be used as the main instrument for ensuring nutritional 
security  among  the  vulnerable  sections,  which  constitute  bulk  of  beneficiaries under this 
programme even during‘normal times'. Under this arrangement, ICDS centres / Aanganwadis register 
additional beneficiaries. 

The Government is seeking the services of self-help groups for providing supplementary 
food to Aanganwadis. During a drought situation, the role of self-help groups can be increased for 
monitoring the health and nutritional status of women and children. Wherever  it  is  necessary  to 
open  additional  Aanganwadis  temporarily,  the  Government  should  sanction  them  and  provide 
finances for these Aanganwadis through the relief funds.

Mid-day Meal Programmes

With  a  view  to  enhance  enrolment,  retention  and  attendance  and  simultaneously  improve 
nutritional  levels  among  children,  the  National  Programme  of  Nutritional  Support  to  Primary 
Education (NP-NSPE) was launched as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme on 15th August 1995 to cover 
children  studying  in  classes  I-V  of  Government,  Government  aided  and  Local  Body  Schools. The 
scheme has been expanded both in coverage and contents since then.  Now the Scheme covers the 
children studying in elementary classes (I-VIII) in Government, Government aided, Special Training 
Centres (STCs) and Madarsas/Maqtabs supported under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).  The name of 
the scheme has also been changed as “Mid Day Meal Scheme in Schools”.  The scheme also provides 
for giving mid day meals during summer vacation in drought affected areas.   

Community Kitchens

In drought situations where certain segments of people, such as the old, disabled, and women, 
are  extremely  distressed,  the  Collectors  should  start  community  kitchens, which  could  be  run 
by the Government itself or through NGOs. These kitchens should be  run  only  during  the  drought 
situation  and  need  to  be  closed  when  the  situation improves,  either  through  provision  of  relief 
employment or improving the state of agriculture.

grAtuitous  AssistAnce

Lead Agency: Relief and Rehabilitation department of State Government and district administration.
Support  Agency:  Ministry  of  Agriculture  &  FW,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Finance 
(Government of India). 
Objectives:  Provision of gratuitous assistance in cash or food to old, disabled and destitute persons 
in  drought-affected  areas  as  per  SDRF/NDRF  norms. The  State  Government  should  lay  down  clear 
and reasonable selection criteria for such beneficiaries. Care should be taken to ensure that only such 
individuals or families without any source of income, livelihood or social welfare benefits and on the 
verge of destitution/starvation be selected. 

 y

 y

 y

 y

 y

Survey of Eligible Persons
 y

As soon as drought is declared, the Collector should survey the population and prepare a list of 
people who are eligible for gratuitous assistance as per the selection guidelines laid down by the 
State Government. 
The State Government could consider having list of persons eligible for gratuitous assistance 
approved by the Gram Sabha.
The list of people qualifying for gratuitous assistance would be regularly maintained and made 
available for inspections.
The local district official such as the Tehsildar / Block Development Officer / Circle Officer should 
compile a list of all persons identified for the distribution of gratuitous assistance and forward it to 
the Collector. In certain cases, the district officials can test-check the list.

Distribution of Gratuitous Assistance
 y

In situations of acute drought instances may come to light of starvation on account of infirmity, 
sickness,  old  age  or  otherwise,  where  it  may  become  necessary  to  organize  community 
kitchens or supply cooked food. 
In remote areas, the Government may also consider setting up foodgrains bank to support the 
destitute, infirm, and  old  on  a  temporary  basis. The  Government  may also  take  the  help  of 
the Gram Panchayats or NGOs to operate such foodgrains bank. Detailed instructions need to 
be issued for setting up and operating foodgrains bank.
Collector should take all possible steps to prevent starvation deaths. 

Administration of Gratuitous Relief
 y

To the extent possible, disbursement of gratuitous relief should be through DBT making use of 
Jan  Dhan  accounts.  Only  in  exceptional  circumstances  to  be  recorded  in  writing  should  cash 
disbursement be permitted. Village-level officials would maintain a record of cash disbursement.

 y

 y

 y

 y

Each State Government may take decisions on remissions, waivers, deferments, loan restructuring, 
concessions etc, taking into account the  fiscal situation of the State and severity of the drought. 
Following steps can be considered by the State:

 y Grant remission of land revenue as payable under  the  relevant  Land  Revenue  Code  for  those 

farmers affected by drought. 
The  State  Government  may  postpone  recovery  of  dues  like  Tagai  / Taccavi, arrears  of  water, 
irrigation and electricity charges, or any other dues related to agriculture from farmers. If recovery 
is not postponed, the State  Government  can  issue  instructions  for  not  recovering  dues  from 
the farmers and other agricultural workers by applying coercive measures.
The  State  Government  may  consider  converting  short-term  loans  and  reschedule  current 
installment  of  medium-term  loans  for  farmers  in  the  drought-affected  areas.  The  State 
Government  should  make  necessary  provision  for  restructuring  / rescheduling  of  these 
loans and pay to the concerned banks.
The State Government may issue instructions to all cooperative banks through the  Department 
of Cooperation to convert or reschedule kharif loans by the end of March, when assessment of 
crop losses are available and final annewari / paisewari values are published.
The  Collector  should  furnish  details  of  annewari  /  paisewari  values  or  any  other assessment 
of crop losses to cooperative banks to facilitate the conversion or re- scheduling of such loans. 
Tehsildars  /  Block  Development  Officer  /  Circle  Officer can  issue  necessary  certificates  to  the 
District Registrar of Cooperatives to enable the banks to grant conversion facility to the affected 
farmers.
The State Government may issue instructions to the cooperative banks not to apply coercive 
measures for recovering their loans or dues in the drought-affected areas.
The  State  Government  can  decide  to  waive  education  /  examination  fees  for  the students in 
Government schools located in drought-affected areas.

cAttle cAmps And fodder supply

Lead  Agency:  State  Government  departments  of  animal  husbandry  and  the  district 
administration.
Support  Agency:  Ministry  of  Agriculture & FW  (Government  of  India),  Indian  Grassland  
and  Forest  Research  Institute  (IGFRI),  Railways,  State  Agricultural  Universities  and  Tribal  / 
Forests produce marketing agencies.
Objectives:  State  Governments  need  to  support  their  farmers  in  protecting  their  cattle 
population  during  a  drought  situation  by  providing  necessary  assistance  for  fodder,  feed, 
and cattle health services. This would discourage distress selling of cattle and help farmers to 
maintain a very important part of their asset base.

Cattle  wealth  is  the  mainstay  of  the  rural  economy. As  small  and  marginal  farmers constitute 
about 80% of the total community of farmers in the country for whom, cattle often is a valuable asset 
to help supplement incomes from their small landholdings. Cattle ownership diversifies production 
and resource management options, increases total farm production and income, provides year-round 
employment  and  spreads  risk.  Studies  shown  that  the  more  cattle  heads  a  farmer  owns,  the  less 
vulnerable the farmer is to risks. During a drought situation, every measure needs to be taken to save 
useful cattle from mortality or distress sale by making arrangements for drinking water, fodder and 
medicines etc. 

Steps to provide fodder:
 y On  receiving  information  about  fodder  scarcity  becoming  imminent  as  a  result  of  failure  or 
inadequacy  of  rains  in  July–August  or  the  failure  or  inadequacy  in  rabi  rains,  the  Collector 
should have surveys done for assessment of fodder availability, the price trends and the expected 
demand in the light of cattle population in vulnerable areas. The cattle census figures and other 
data with the District Animal Husbandry Officer will be useful for this purpose. 
The  Collector  should  submit  a  detailed  report  to  the  State  Government,  which  provides 
information on the cattle population, the area under fodder, the estimated fodder  production 
and  the  shortage  of  fodder  in  the  district. The  Collector  can suggest measures for increasing 
fodder supply in the area.
The State Government, upon the receipt of such a report, should issue detailed instructions  for 
maintaining the supply of fodder, either through procurement of fodder, or by setting up cattle 
camps or fodder depots / bank, or by encouraging farmers to undertake fodder cultivation.

 y

 y

The State Government should authorize the Collector to ensure the availability of fodder in 

the drought-affected areas by taking the following steps:

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Encourage farmers to undertake fodder cultivation on the banks of canals or other areas under 
irrigation. Subsidy in the form of seeds should be provided for fodder cultivation;
Request the Chief Conservator of Forests and Divisional Forest Officers to protect the available 
grass in the forests; and
Consider  imposing  a  ban  on  the  movement  of  fodder  from  the  district  to  another district  or 
outside the State.

Special Measures for Increasing Fodder Supply
 y

The State Government should issue instructions to the Collector to take the following measures 
for increasing the supplying of fodder:
Procure  fodder  through  the  Forest  Department  or  the  Forest  Development Corporation at 
a price fixed by the State Government;
Procure  fodder  through  traders, private  cultivators, Tribal  Development Corporation etc. at a 
price declared by the State Government; 
Procure fodder from the neighbouring States. 
Procure feed blocks if necessary for milk-producing cattle and arrange strategic placement of 
feed reserves;
Establish  fodder  depots  in  the  drought-affected  Talukas  for  selling  fodder,  cattle  feed  and 
concentrates at a price fixed by the State Government;
Fix the price of fodder so that it is affordable to the farmers. Provide subsidy for the purchase of 
fodder supplied through fodder depots. The price should be published and displayed prominently 
in the fodder depot to make the farmers aware;

 y Maintain accounts of sale of fodder through fodder depots. These accounts need to be  open  to 

inspection;

 y Organize  distribution  of  fodder  through  societies  by  way  of  Tagai  /  Taccavi  to  the  needy 

agriculturists and particularly to small holders in the affected areas;
Set up cattle camps or feeding centres either through  district  administration  or  the  NGOs for 
feeding the cattle.
Fix  the  quantity  of  fodder  and  feed  to  be  provided  in  the  cattle  camp  with  the assistance of 
the State animal husbandry department. Fodder and feed should be issued for each  cattle in 
accordance with these standards.
Arrange  water  supply  for  all  the  cattle  camps  in  accordance  with  the  total  number  of  cattle 
admitted in these camps.

 y Maintain accounts of the fodder and feed provided through the cattle camps and reconcile  it 
with the number of cattle staying in a cattle camp. Each cattle camp must maintain a register, 
showing the number of cattle staying there and the total stock of fodder and feed on a daily 
basis.
Conduct necessary inspection of cattle camps to ensure that fodder and feed are being provided 
to cattle in these camps and sanitation and cleanliness measures in these camps are adequate.

in consultation with the State Dairy Development Department;
Arrange with Gaushalas and other NGOs for taking care of cattle, on a per cattle head payment 
basis; 
In extraordinary situations, the fodder requirement may be arranged through Railways from 
surplus States.
Increase awareness among farmers about the feeding requirements of cattle during drought to 
ensure their health and productivity; and
 

Information  on  cattle  camps  and  fodder  supply  can  be provided  through  Form  Nos.  5 
and  6 ,  included  in Annexure 1.
Based on the migration pattern of cattle, States may consider organizing cattle camps in the 
districts not affected by drought. 
States may consider providing fodder to farmers who do not prefer to send their livestock to 
cattle camps.
Promote drought resilient local grasses, shrubs, tree varieties on the banks of canals, water 
bodies etc. for moisture conservation. 

 

 

Role of the Animal Husbandry Department
 y

At the request of the Collector, the State Animal Husbandry Department should make available 
the fodder, feed, and water requirement for each cattle.
The  Animal  Husbandry  Department  would  check  the  quality  of  feed  and  fodder  supplied 
through  the  fodder  depots  and  cattle  camps.  It  would  ensure  and  certify  that  the  feed  and 
fodder being provided are fit for cattle consumption.
The Animal Husbandry Department would provide minerals, vitamins, medicines and vaccines 
at minimum cost to the farmers. The Department would also carry out the necessary inspections 
and checks in drought-affected areas to ensure that cattle are maintained in good health.
The Animal Husbandry Department would depute inspectors who would check the health of 
cattle in cattle camps at frequent intervals, at least once a week, and undertake all precautionary 
measures to avoid outbreak of any disease.
The Animal Husbandry Department would undertake campaigns in the drought- affected areas 
to increase the awareness of farmers about cattle health issues related to fodder and feed, vitamin 
and minerals and other sanitation issues.

Role of the Forest Department
 y

At the request of the Collector, the Forest Department / Forest Development Corporation should 
maintain stocks of grass for the use of the distressed Cattle Population in the drought hit areas. 
The  cutting  of  grass  should  be  completed  as  early  as  possible  and  should  be  properly  dried, 
converted to hay and stocked. The Forest Department should also make arrangements for the 
transportation of fodder to places suggested by the Collector. The Government should sanction 
the necessary expenditure for fodder operations to be undertaken by the Forest Department.

76

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Role of the Agriculture Department
 y

The  Agriculture  Department  through  its  various  bodies  and  especially  through  ATMA,  would 
encourage  individual  farmers  to  undertake  cultivation of fodder, wherever possible. It would 
provide fodder seeds and fertilizers to the farmers for cultivating fodder, wherever possible; and 
extension services for undertaking short duration grasses and seasonal fodder crops.
The  Agriculture  Department  can  also  undertake  cultivation  of  fodder  on  the  land owned by 
the agricultural universities. Generally, agricultural universities have huge tracts  of  land, which 
could  be  used  for  this  purpose. The  Government  needs  to provide subsidy to the agriculture 
universities for cultivating fodder.
The Agriculture Department can also grow fodder on the seed farms, wherever available or on 
Demo plots under ATMA. The Government should provide a grant for seeds, fertilizers and other 
expenditures, depending on the extent of area covered under fodder cultivation.

Role of the Irrigation Department
 y

The irrigation department should extend all necessary cooperation to the Collector for promoting 
fodder  cultivation  by  providing  water  for  irrigation  on  a  priority basis. Such water could be 
provided to the farmers at a cheaper rate.
The irrigation department should consider allowing reservoir and tank beds under its control to 
be leased out for cultivating short duration grasses or seasonal fodder crops. The Collector, with 
the permission of the irrigation department, could lease out the reservoir and tank bed land on 
short-term  lease  subject  to  the  condition that  the  lessees  should  grow  fodder  crop  therein 
and agree to sell the grass / fodder to needy farmers at the price to be fixed by the Collector.

institutionAl response

The  effectiveness  of  Drought  management  response  is  a  reflection  of  the  robustness  of  the 

government institutional structures .

While  primary  responsibility  to  monitor,  declare,  plan  and  manage  response  is  of  the  State 
Government, yet a critical supportive role is contemplated under the present scheme of things for the 
Central Government. The district administration headed by the Collector spearheads the government 
institutional  response  to  drought  on  the  ground.  Drought  thus  requires  efficient  coordination  at 
multiple levels.

Role of the Central  Government
 y

The  Department  of  Agriculture,  Cooperation  and  Farmers  Welfare(DAC&FW),  Ministry  of 
Agriculture  &  Farmers Welfare  (MoA&FW)  is  responsible  for  monitoring  and  coordinating  the 
central government response to drought.
An  officer  of  the  rank  of  an  Additional  Secretary  in  the  DAC&FW  is  designated  as  the 
“Central  Drought  Relief  Commissioner”  for  the  purpose.  SDRF  and  NDRF  are,  however, 
administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs and assistance under these schemes are released 
by the Ministry of Finance upon the recommendation of the High Level Committee  (HLC).
A Crisis Management Group functions under the Chairmanship of the Central Drought Relief 
Commissioner  with  representatives  of  Ministries  and  organizations.  The  Crisis  Management 
Group meets from time to time to review the drought situation in the country and progress 
of relief measures.
The  CWWG,  is  an  arrangement  for  monitoring  and  early  warning  of  any  drought  like 
development in any part of the country on a regular basis. 
In the event of a declaration of drought, the Central Drought Relief Commissioner (CDRC) should 
monitor and review the progress of relief measures and apprise the National Crisis Management 
Committee.

Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).
States have adopted various mechanisms for managing drought like State Executive Committee 
in accordance with the provision of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Cabinet Sub-committee, 
Secretaries’ Committee under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary for taking policy decisions 
on drought. 

 y Drought management requires coordination with departments of agriculture, horticulture, animal 
husbandry,  water  resources,  irrigation,  social  welfare,  public  distribution,  rural  development, 
school education, power, drinking water, public health, and finance. 

Role of the District Administration
 y

The  district  administration  under  the  leadership  of  the  Collector  implements  all  decisions 
related  to  drought  management  on  the  ground. The  implementation  takes  places  through  a 
number  of  line  departments  and  field  agencies  working  on the  ground. The  effectiveness  of 
drought  management  is  largely  dependent upon coordination among agencies working at 
the district level.
As per extant revenue codes in many States, the expression “Collector” includes all subordinate 
officials  of  the  Revenue  Department  such  as  Additional  Collector,  Deputy  Collector,  Sub- 
divisional  Officer  and  Tehsildar.  All  the  subordinate  officers  perform  their  tasks  and  exercise 
powers related to drought management on behalf of the Collector.
The Collectors should ensure monitoring all the indicators of drought on the ground such as, 
collection  of  daily  data  on  rainfall  water  storage  position,  water  availability  and  supply  and 
progress of sowing operations. The Collector should also monitor local information related to 
demand for relief employment, prices of food grains and the availability of fodder.

The  Collector  must  be  authorized  to  direct  all  the  line  departments  at  the  district  level  to 
participate in drought management, prepare contingency plans and mobilize their staff and 
resources e.g. in the identification of works and preparation of estimates for shelf of progress 
for  relief  employment  in  the  drought-affected  areas.  The  Collector  should  be  authorized  to 
requisition vehicles and equipments on payment basis to mount relief operation.
The Collector needs to assess the situation related to scarcity of drinking water and fodder and 
issue appropriate instructions regarding reservation of drinking water, supply of drinking water 
through tankers, procurement and sale  of fodder, and  setting  up  of  fodder  depots  and  cattle 
camps as mentioned in the relevant sections of the manual. The Collector should exercise similar 
authority in any other area which is affected by drought.
The role of the Collector is that of an effective coordinator of drought management. The Collector 
must  be  able  to  provide  a  sense  of  mission  and  direction  to  all  the  line  departments  and 
agencies working for drought relief. It is necessary that the Collector  provides  the  necessary 
help  and  support  to  all  the  agencies  for performing their tasks more effectively.
At the district level, a district drought / disaster management committee should be set up under 
the chairmanship of the Collector with members consisting of public representatives, line departments. 
The SDMCs and DDMCs shall provide all relevant information to the said Committee. The 
Committee  should  meet frequently and review the progress of drought relief measures in the 
district. The district-level committee can become a very effective forum for addressing peoples’ 
concerns and applying correctives in drought management.

Role of Panchayati Raj Institutions
 y

It  is  necessary  to  involve  the  Panchayati  Raj  institutions  (PRIs) - Zilla  Parishads, Panchayat 
Samitis, and Village Panchayats - in the implementation of drought management programmes.
PRIs need to provide funds for water conservation and maintenance of water supply schemes.
Efforts  should  be  made  to  identify  the  projects  related  to  sustainable  natural  resource 
management, water conservation etc. to support drought mitigation in the vulnerable regions.
The  PRIs  need  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  regulation  of  water  use  at  the individual 
household  and  village  level.  It  should  recommend  using  water  resources  for  the  purpose  of 
drinking and fodder cultivation.

Role of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organizations 
(CSOs)
 y

The  State  Government  and  district  administration  need  to  involve  NGOs  in  organizing 
drought relief. NGOs and CSOs have the advantage of local presence and community outreach 
which  could  be  utilized  for  organizing  distribution  of  relief  assistance  and  implementing 

81

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

 y

mitigation programs. NGOs can also be very effective in providing feedback to the Government 
and securing corrective actions.
The State Government and district administration can set up a coordination forum for NGOs and 
CSOs  at  the  State  and  district  levels  respectively. The  coordination forum  meetings  can  be 
convened  to  discuss  the  drought  situation  and  the implementation of relief programmes.
 y NGOs  and  CSOs  can  monitor  various  indicators  of  drought,  particularly  its  impact  on  the 
people, and bring these to the attention of the State Government. The State Government can 
initiate necessary relief measures in drought-affected areas, based on  the  feedback  from  these 
organizations.

 y NGOs  and  CSOs  can  convey  the  local  demand  for  relief  employment  to  the  district 
administration. They can suggest specific works to be started so that the people are  provided 
with  employment  within  a  short  distance  of  their  homes. These organizations can help the 
district  administration  in  planning  relief  employment in a way that durable community assets 
are created. They can also coordinate with the local administration in ensuring the payment of 
wages and foodgrains on time.

 y NGOs  and  CSOs  can  work  with  the  local  community  in  augmenting  the  sources  of  drinking 
water through repairing wells, hand-pumps, tanks, ponds and any other local water structure. 
They can also help the community in regulating water use within the community and ensuring 
equitable distribution of available water.

 y NGOs and CSOs can monitor the distribution of foodgrains through Fair Price Shops and prevent 
hoarding and diversion of foodgrains in the open market. They can ensure that foodgrains are 
supplied to all the Fair Price Shops, particularly those in the remote areas and all the people in the 
drought-affected areas can purchase foodgrains through these shops as per their entitlements. 
NGOs and CSOs can also monitor that the people are paid their wages in the form of foodgrains 
as per the norms fixed by the government.

 y NGOs and CSOs can provide assistance to the sick, elderly and disabled people in the  drought 
situation. They  can  run  community  kitchens  with  Government assistance. NGOs need to 
bring the cases of hunger and starvation to the attention of the Government.
In consultation with the Government, NGOs and CSOs can monitor the functioning of ICDS and 
mid-day meals so that the children get necessary nutrition during the period of drought. They 
can also bring to the attention of the Government the cases of malnutrition among infants and 
children.

 y

 y NGOs  and  CSOs  can  set  up  cattle  camps  and  fodder  depots  after  obtaining  the necessary 
authorization  from  the  Government.  They  can  receive  Government  assistance  as  per  the 
SDRF / NDRF norms as well as the necessary veterinary care for this purpose.

 y NGOs  and  CSOs  need  to  help  the  Government  in  dealing  with  the  public  health aspects of 
drought.  They can assist the Government in disinfecting sources of water,  creating  awareness 
about  public  health  issues  and  monitoring  malnutrition  and disease among drought-affected 
population.

finAncing relief expenditure

In post-independent India, financing relief expenditure has largely been arranged through the 
Finance Commission appointed under Article 280 of the Constitution. In the earlier phases, the 
role of the Commission was restricted to suggesting  the  pattern  of  financial  assistance  by  the 
centre. Subsequently, the recommendations were enlarged to cover the “scheme of financing relief 
expenditure”.

The present arrangement of financing relief expenditure has two streams: (i) SDRF and (ii) NDRF.

The SDRF envisaged the contribution of Central and the concerned State  Governments 
in the ratio of 3:1 for a fund to be kept outside the Government Account so  that  there  is  no  cash 
flow  constraint  for  initiating  relief  operations. The  Centre’s share is normally released in two half-
yearly installments, subject to the guidelines in this regard. Funds from the SDRF are to be spent on 
specific, pre-determined  items  of expenditure  at  predetermined  scales, as  specified  in  the  SDRF 
guidelines. The  NDRF  provides  funds  for  natural  calamities  of  severe  nature  when  the  balances 
available  in the  SDRF  are  not  adequate  for  meeting  relief  expenditures. It is replenished through 
a  surcharge  on  certain  central  taxes.  The  Thirteenth  Finance  Commission  had  recommended 
the  use  of  NDRF  for “calamities  of  severe  nature”,  this  fund  is  used  to  meet  the  expenditure  on 
all  natural  calamities  as  recommended  by  Finance  Commissions  from  time  to  time,  where  relief 
expenditure exceeds the amount balance in the SDRF.

The Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure), Government of India releases assistance 
from both the SDRF and NDRF.  The SDRF is released to all the States in normal course, irrespective 
of its level of relief expenditure, while the NDRF funds are released when  the  States  make  specific 
requests, following a well-laid out procedure.

Administration of SDRF
The State Government needs to take following steps for the administration of SDRF:

 y

 y

Check the opening balance of the SDRF in the beginning of the financial year. All money that 
remains unspent at the end of preceding financial year is shown as the opening balance in the 
next financial year.
Submit an utilization certificate for the amount spent through the SDRF, well in time so that the 
SDRF allocations are released twice in year.

 y Get  the  SDRF  expenditures  audited  through  the  Office  of  Accountant-General. These  audit 

reports must be submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.

Release of NDRF Funds
 y Whenever a State faces a calamity of severe nature and the expenditure from the SDRF exceeds 
its existing balance, a request is made to the Government of India for release of funds from the 

83

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

NDRF. For drought, hailstorm, pest-attack and cold wave/frost, the request is made to the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and for other identified natural calamities, the Ministry of 
Home Affairs has the necessary jurisdiction.
The State Government submits the request for release of NDRF funds through a Memorandum. A 
Memorandum is an important representation of the State Government, providing detailed 
information  on  the  geographical  extent  and severity  of  drought,  losses  and  damages  in  all 
the sectors, relief needs, and the request for assistance from the NDRF.
A  Memorandum  needs  to  be  a  balanced  document,  objectively  describing  the  drought 
situation, assessing the impact and estimating the relief needs. The  structure and  template  for 
preparation of a Memorandum is included in  Annexure  4.
The  State  Government  should  submit  the  Memorandum  to  the  Ministry  of Agriculture 
and Farmers Welfare  only after declaring drought.
After the State Government declares drought and submits the Memorandum, the Ministry of 
Agriculture  sends  an  Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) to  the  concerned  State  for  making 
an  assessment  of  the  drought  situation. This  team  consists  of  officials  from  different  Central 
Government  Ministries/Departments,  such  as  Agriculture,  Animal  Husbandry,  Food,  Rural 
Development, Power, Drinking  Water, NITI Aayog, Finance, Home etc.
The  team  carries  out  extensive  visits of  drought-affected  areas  in  the  State  during  which 
it  is  expected  to  assess  ground  level  situation  pertaining  to  crop  damage,  drinking 
water, fodder shortage etc., meet local officials, farmers, PRI members, women’s groups, etc. 
The team then submits a report to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare immediately 
after conclusion of its visit. The report should provide an assessment of the drought situation 
in  terms  of  severity, geographical  spread, impact  on  agriculture, availability of water, food, 
and fodder.
In the report, the team makes a recommendation for NDRF assistance in accordance with  the 
SDRF  guidelines.  The  recommendation  needs  to  be  clear,  precise  and  objective  and  in 
consonance with the SDRF / NDRF norms for assistance.
The report of the team is considered by Sub Committee of the National Executive Committee(SC-
NEC) which is an Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by the Secretary, DAC&FW (Government of 
India) and recommendation made on the quantum of assistance from the NDRF.
The  SC-NEC  recommendation  is  considered  by  a  High-Level  Committee  (HLC), consisting 
of  the  Union  Home  Minister,  Union  Finance  Minister,  Union  Agriculture  Minister  and 
Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. The HLC is chaired by the senior- most Union Cabinet Minister.
After the HLC decision on the SC-NEC recommendation, funds from the NDRF are released by the 
Department of Expenditure on the advice of the MHA after adjusting for the existing balance in 
the SDRF.

Development Programmes for Drought Relief
 y

In addition to the SDRF and NDRF, the Central and State Governments need to take advantage of 
centrally sponsored schemes etc., which permit use of 10% of the allocation as flexifunds to be 
used for drought mitigation. 

84

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

 y

 y

 y

 y

The MGNREGS, National Rural Drinking Water Programme, water conservation programmes can 
play an important role in drought relief. 
All  districts  covered  through  these  programmes  need  to  be  directed  about  using  these 
programmes for generating employment in the drought-affected areas and building assets, such 
as tanks and wells, which can reduce the impact of drought.
At  the  State  and  district  levels,  water  supply  schemes,  regular  schemes  for  fodder cultivation 
and agriculture can be used for supporting various measures of drought relief.
The State Governments need to monitor Crop Insurance Schemes effectively especially in 
vulnerable districts. 

Monitoring Drought Expenditures
 y

The State Government should monitor their drought expenditures regularly. Such monitoring 
mechanisms  should  consist  of  monthly  expenditure  statements, utilization certificates and 
internal and external audits.
The  district  administration  must  provide  monthly  expenditure  statements  on various relief 

measures in a format prescribed by the Government.

The  district  administration  and  implementing  departments  /  agencies  should  submit 
utilization  certificates  for  the  amount  released  for  drought  relief.  Further releases  should  not  be 
made until the utilization certificate is provided.

The State Government needs to organize concurrent audit of expenditures through its internal 

audit wings so that course corrections can be applied on expenditures for various relief measures.

  Information  on  drought  relief  expenditures  can  be  submitted  in  Form  No.  12,  included  in 

Annexure 1.

The Central and State Governments should provide information on all aspects of drought to the 
people and media as and when necessary. 
The  State  Government  should  develop  a  Drought  Management  Information  System  (DMIS) 
covering different aspects of drought management. 

 y DMIS for drought should include information upon key indicators of drought and important 

interventions for relief. DMIS should be updated on a regular basis.
Secretary, Disaster Management / Relief Commissioner should consider submitting reports on 
the drought situation to the State Government/SEC. Form No. 12, included in Annexure 1, can be 
used for preparing such a report.
Secretary, Disaster Management / Relief Commissioner should consider documentation of the 
drought management efforts for guidance in dealing with future droughts. 
State Governments may set up helpline desk to provide information to all the concerned.  State 
Governments could also make use of the Kisan Call Centres (KCCs) and M-Kisan portal of DAC&FW 
for  communicating  audio/text  messages  and  advisories  to  farmers  in  drought  affected  areas. 
Audio conferencing of experts with the farmers registered with KCCs and M-kisan portal also 
could be considered. The State Governments could consider training the Farm Tele Advisors of 
KCCs so as to enable them to render proper advice and suggestions to the farmers in the drought 
affected areas.

Coordination with Media
 y

Sharing information with print,  radio and television media,  is an important  aspect of drought 
management.
Usage of latest ICT technologies for out reach to farmers through Social Media and specially 
designed  Apps  and  platforms  like  Facebook/Whatsapp  to  send  recorded  short  videos/audio 
messages etc could also be considered by the State Governments, depending on the level of reach/
accessibility of the farmers in the areas.

Drought Impact Assessment and evaluation of Response System

States need to take up “Drought impact assessment and evaluation of response system”. It is 
suggested  to  take  up  enumerative  sample  based  house  hold  surveys  with  properly  designed 
questionnaires and capture the impact of drought and evaluate the response system. The information 
available through various drought indices need to be considered in generating random sample for 
inventory.

The  impact  assessment  and  evaluation  of  response  system  is  suggested  to  be  taken  up  as  a 

follow up for every event of drought declaration event in the State.

Crop Insurance
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY):

The PMFBY is a new crop insurance scheme launched by the government from the kharif season 
of 2016. The scheme is aimed at making crop insurance easier, more meaningful and attractive to the 
farmers. 

The major features of PMFBY are:

 y

 y

 y

 y
 y

 y

 y

 y
 y

PMFBY will provide a comprehensive insurance cover against failure of the crop thus help stabilize 
the income of farmers and encourage them in the adoption of innovative practices. 
The Scheme can cover all food & oilseeds crops and annual commercial/ horticultural crops for 
which past yield data is available and for which requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments 
(CCEs) will be conducted as a part of the General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES). 
The scheme is compulsory for loanee farmers obtaining Crop Loan /KCC account for notified 
crops, but is voluntary for Other/non loanee farmers.  
The Maximum Premium payable by the farmers will be 2% for all Kharif food & oilseeds crops, 
1.5% for Rabi food & oilseeds crops and 5% for annual commercial/horticultural crops.
The difference between premium and the rate of Insurance charges payable by farmers shall be 
shared equally by the Centre and State. 
The seasonality discipline shall be same for loanee and non-loanee farmers. 
The scheme will be implemented by Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) and other 
empanelled private general insurance companies. Selection of Implementing Agency (IA) will be 
done by the concered State Government through bidding. 
The existing State Level Co-ordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI), Sub-Committee to 
SLCCCI, District Level Monitoring Committee (DLMC) shall be responsible for proper management 
of the Scheme. 
The Scheme shall be implemented on an ‘Area Approach basis’. The unit of insurance shall be 
Village/Village Panchayat level for major crops and for other crops it may be a unit of size above 
the level of Village/Village Panchayat. 
The Loss assessment for crop losses due to non-preventable natural risks will be on Area approach. 
In case of majority of insured crops of a notified area are prevented from sowing/planting the 
insured crops due to adverse weather conditions that will be eligible for indemnity claims upto 
maximum of 25% of the sum-insured. 

 y However  losses  due  to  localised  perils  (Hailstorm,  landslide  &  inundation)  and  Post-Harvest 
losses due to specified perils, (Cyclone/Cyclonic rain & Unseasonal rains) shall be assessed at the 
affected insured field of the individual insured farmer.

Three levels of Indemnity, viz., 70%, 80% and 90% corresponding to crop Risk in the areas shall 
be available for all crops. 
The Threshold Yield (TY) shall be the benchmark yield level at which Insurance protection shall 
be given to all the insured farmers in an Insurance Unit Threshold of the notified crop will be 
moving  average  of  yield  of  last  seven  years  excluding  yield  upto  two  notified  calamity  years 
multiplied by Indemnity level. 
In case of smaller States, the whole State shall be assigned to one IA (2-3 for comparatively big 
States). Selection of IA may be made for at least 3 years. 
The  designated  /  empanelled  companies  participating  in  bidding  have  to  bid  the  premium 
rates for all the crops notified / to be notified by the State Govt. and non-compliance will lead to 
rejection of company’s bid.
Crop Cutting Experiments (CCE) shall be undertaken per unit area /per crop, on a sliding scale, 
as prescribed under the scheme outline and operational guidelines. Improved Technology like 
Remote sensing, Drone etc. will be utilised for estimation of yield losses.
State  governments  should  use  Smart  phone  apps  for  video/image  capturing  CCEs  process 
and transmission thereof with CCE data on a real time basis for timely, reliable and transparent 
estimation of yield data 
The  cost  of  using  technology  etc.  for  conduct  of  CCEs  etc.  will  be  shared  between  Central 
Government and State/U.T. Governments on 50:50 basis. 
There will be a provision of on account claims in case of adverse seasonal conditions during crop 
season viz. floods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought, and unseasonal rains. 

 y On account payment upto 25% of likely claims will be provided, if the expected yield during the 

 y
 y

season is likely to be less than 50% of normal yield. 
The claim amount will be credited electronically to the individual Insured Bank Account. 
Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/ areas.
State Governments need to participate in these PMFBY and ensure that the insurance coverage 
increases to 50% of farmers. Farmers need to be informed about the availability of insurance products 
and  educated  about  the  need  for  managing  their  yield  and  income  risks  by  getting  insurance 
coverage. As the coverage of agricultural insurance in the country     increases, insurance schemes for 
drought protection would become more viable.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

The containment and mitigation of the crippling impact of drought, and the eventual attainment 
of the objective of drought proofing of an area is contingent upon a proactive and relentless, but 
planned pursuit of a combination of structural / physical and non-structural long and short term 
measures.  The short term measures are mostly reactive or relief centric in nature and mostly relate 
to  in-season  drought  management  through  contingency  planning  and  relief  distribution.    Long 
term  mitigation  measures  are  geared  towards  the  adaptation  to  climate  change,  restoration  of 
ecological balance through adoption of sustainable agronomic and conservation practices, sensible 
crop  choices  etc.    Most  of  these  measures  are  translated  on  the  ground  through  soil  and  water 
conservation, watershed management, agronomic practices suited to rainfed agriculture and forestry 
programmes that seek to integrate soil, water and forestry management in an ecological compliant 
and sustainable manner.

Drought  mitigation  needs  to  be  ensconced  in  the  regular  development  programmes  of  the 
Centre and State Governments. Some of the most significant current national programmes that may 
have a decisive bearing on drought mitigation are Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna, National 
Rainfed Area Development Programme, National Rural Drinking Water Programme etc.  Many of these 
programmes can be guided towards the development of  a cogent drought mitigation strategy at the 
State level by taking advantage of the flexibility which has been in-built into the centrally sponsored 
schemes for the purposes of mitigation of calamities like drought.

Current Drought Mitigation Programmes 
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)

Pradhan  Mantri  Krishi  Sinchayee  Yojana  (PMKSY)  has  been  formulated  with  the  vision  of 
extending the coverage of irrigation ‘Har Khet ko pani’ and improving water use efficiency ‘More crop 
per drop’ in a focused manner with end to end solution on source creation, distribution, management, 
field application and extension activities. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was 
approved by the Central Government in 2015-16.

PMKSY  has  been  formulated  as  an  umbrella  scheme  amalgamating  ongoing  schemes  viz. 
Accelerated  Irrigation  Benefits  Programme  (AIBP)  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  River 
Development  &  Ganga  Rejuvenation  (MoWR,  RD&GR), 
Integrated  Watershed  Management 
Programme (IWMP) of Department of Land Resources (DoLR) and the On Farm Water Management 
(OFWM) of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW). The Ministry-wise 
activities are presented in Table 1.

The major objective of PMKSY is to achieve convergence of investments in major and medium 
irrigation projects with command area development to provide assured irrigation, improve on-farm 
water use efficiency to reduce wastage of water, enhance the adoption of precision-irrigation and 
other  water  saving  technologies  (More  crop  per  drop),  scientific  and  sustainable  development  of 
watersheds, enhance recharge of aquifers and introduce sustainable water conservation practices 
and attract greater private investment in precision irrigation system.

District  Irrigation  Plans  (DIPs)  shall  be  the  cornerstone  for  planning  and  implementation  of 
PMKSY.  DIPs  will  identify  the  gaps  in  irrigation  infrastructure  after  taking  into  consideration  the 
District Agriculture Plans (DAPs) already prepared for Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) vis-à-vis

irrigation infrastructure currently available and resources that would be added during XII Plan from 
other ongoing schemes (both State and Central), like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment 
Guarantee  Scheme  (MGNREGS),  Rashtriya  Krishi  Vikas  Yojana  (RKVY),  Rural 
Infrastructure  
Development Fund (RIDF), Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme, Member 
of Legislative Assembly Local Area Development (MLALAD) Scheme, Local body funds etc. The gaps 
identified under Strategic Research & Extension Plan (SREGP) will be made use in preparation of DIP.

DIPs will present holistic irrigation development perspective of the district outlining medium to 
long term development plans integrating three components viz. water sources, distribution network 
and water use applications incorporating all usage of water like drinking & domestic use, irrigation 
and industry. Preparation of DIP will be taken up as joint exercise of all participating departments. DIP 
will form the compendium of all existing and proposed water resource network system in the district.

The DIPs may be prepared at two levels, the block and the district. Keeping in view the convenience 
of map preparation and data collection, the work would be primarily done at block level. Block wise 
irrigation plan is to be prepared depending on the available and potential water resources and water 
requirement for agriculture sector prioritising the activities based on socio-economic and location 
specific requirement. In case planning is made based on basin/sub basin level, the comprehensive 
irrigation plan may cover more than one district. The activities identified in the basin/sub-basin plan 
can be further segregated into district/block level action plans. Use of satellite imagery, topo sheets 
and available database may be appropriately utilised for developing irrigation plans at least on pilot 
basis to begin with and subsequently may be extended to all projects.

State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary of the respective States 
are authorized to sanction projects, oversee its implementation and monitoring. National Executive 
Committee  (NEC)  under  the  Chairmanship  of Vice  Chairman,  NITI  Aayog  will  oversee  programme 
implementation, allocation of resources, inter-ministerial coordination, monitoring & performance 
assessment, addressing administrative issues. At National level, programme is to be supervised and 
monitored  by  an  Inter-Ministerial  National  Steering  Committee  (NSC)  under  the  Chairmanship  of 
Hon’ble Prime Minister with Union Ministers of concerned Ministries as a Member.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) 
Considering the importance of water conservation, and given all the scientific and technological 
advances  at  their  command,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  in  consultation  and  agreement 
with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has developed an actionable Framework to ensure that MGNREGS 
funds are used in accordance with the best practices in the sector. 

The need for drought proofing villages in water stressed blocks was being felt for many years. 
Many State Governments have started excellent initiatives for water conservation in last few years 
using Mahatma Gandhi NREGA funds viz. the  ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swalalamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, 
the ‘Dobha’  or  Farm  Ponds  construction  in  Jharkhand,  the ‘Mission  Kakatiya’  in Telangana. ‘Neeru 
Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, ‘Kapil Dhara’ in Madhya Pradesh, bore well recharge in Karnataka, ‘Jalyukt 
Shivar’ in Maharashtra are some of the recent initiatives. The present Framework draws on many of 
the good practices in these States and some other initiatives.

The Framework strives to leverage the synergies between Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, Pradhan 
Mantri  Krishi  Sinchayee  Yojana,  IWMP  and  Command  Area  Development  &  Water  Management 
programmes,  given  their  common  objectives.  Types  of  common  works  undertaken  under  these 
programmes/  schemes  are  water  conservation  and  management,  water  harvesting,  soil  and 
moisture conservation, groundwater recharge, flood protection, land development, Command Area 
Development  &  Water  Management  (CAD&WM).  These  programmes  were  addressing  the  above 
mentioned activities with their own set of planning tools, processes, technical expertise and financial 
resources  which  is  now  envisioned  to  be  used  in  coordination  to  bring  the  advantages  of  each 
programmes/ schemes to strengthen a concerted action for water conservation and management. 

The highlights of the Frameworks are:-

 y

Paradigm shift from Relief Works approach to Integrated Natural Resource Management 
(INRM) approach in implementation of MGNREGS.
 

Planned  and  systematic  development  of  land  and  harnessing  of  rainwater  following 
watershed principles to become the central focus of MGNREGS works.
All lands falling under the watershed will be developed on ridge to valley treatment principle.
Individual works (including work on private land) will be logically sequenced and packaged 
together on the principles of INRM, to form projects following the principles of watershed 
management in an integrated manner.
Systematic identification, planning and implementation of projects leading to creation of 
sustainable and productive assets for the community.

Under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, 153 works  are permissible  of which 100   relate to NRM alone 

(of which 71 are water related works). Refer Annexure I

As per the list provided by Central Ground Water Board, 112 districts from 13 states are categorised 
as most ‘Irrigation Deprived’ Districts. Due to over utilisation of ground water, 1068 blocks (from 18 
States)  and  217  blocks  (from  17  States)  categorised  as ‘Over  Exploited  Blocks  and  Critical  Blocks' 
respectively.

In upcoming years i.e. FY 2017-18 and onwards, focus will be given to these ‘Irrigation Deprived’ 

districts and ‘Water Stressed’ Blocks.

Technological support will be taken from National Remote Sensing Centre, ISRO for identification 
and planning of watersheds and monitoring of each and every activity undertaken and missed out. 
Central Ground Water Board is storehouse of information related to groundwater resource and have 
technical expertise available at regional/ State level on designs and structures suitable/ required for 
water stressed blocks based on their geomorphological and climatic zone.

Creation of sustainable livelihoods is one of the desired outputs of NRM/ IWMP works; hence, the 
Self Help Groups (SHGs) under NRLM will be closely involved in the planning and implementation 
of  watershed  projects  under  Mahatma  Gandhi  NREGS.  The  Mahila  Kisan  Sashaktikaran  Pariyojna 
farmers falling under these areas shall be linked on priority basis.

Watershed management works can be taken up independently under MGNREGA where there 
is no IWMP project sanctioned/proposed and in convergence with IWMP- wherever IWMP project is 
already sanctioned and proposed (new IWMP Projects).

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

The comprehensive watershed plan shall be prepared in accordance with the concepts of ridge to 
valley treatment. It is recommended to use the satellite imagery for this planning work. For selection 
of  the  appropriate  sites  and  preparing  the  above  plans,  the  Engineers/Technical  Assistants  and 
Mates of MGNREGS at Block and GP level would be trained and supported by the State Level Nodal 
Agency (SLNA) of IWMP and technical personnel of WCDC, the cost of which would be met by the 
Administrative cost of MGNREGS.  Watershed works will preferably be taken up in cluster approach.

Drought Mitigation measures

The objectives of these mitigation measures are to reduce soil erosion, augment soil moisture, 
restrict surface run-off of rainwater and improve the efficiency of water use. It involves a wide range 
of soil and water conservation measures and farm practices.

Water Harvesting and Conservation

Water  harvesting  and  conservation  refer  to  processes  and  structures  of  rainfall  and  run-  off 
collection  from  large  catchments  area  and  channelling  them  for  human  consumption.  In  India, 
these processes and structures have been in existence since antiquity, but the increasing frequency 
and severity of droughts and population growth have focused on the revival of these practices and 
structures. Every household’s minimum water requirements can be easily met by collecting rainwater 
locally from village / community ponds / large manmade containers, by diverting and storing water 
from local streams / springs and by tapping sub-surface water below river / stream beds.

There  are  two  methods  for  water  conservation:  (i)  artificial  recharge  of  groundwater,  and 
(ii)  traditional  methods. While  the  artificial  recharge  of  groundwater  is  used  extensively  in  all  the 
watershed development programmes being implemented, traditional methods of water collection 
and harvesting through ponds / tanks are even more important for assuring continuous and reliable 
access  to  water.  Both  methods  include  measures  which  are  low-cost,  community-oriented  and 
environment-friendly. It is necessary for the Government and NGOs working in the area of water 
conservation to promote both sets of measures, depending on the local conditions.

These methods are considered very useful for groundwater recharge both when rainfall is deficient 
and when there are flash floods (that result in overtopping of defined courses of rivers / streams 
and  their  spreading  into  flood  plains).  Harvesting  and  conservation  of  floodwater  to  rejuvenate 
depleted high-capacity aquifers by adopting integrated groundwater recharge techniques, such as 
dams, tanks, anicuts, percolation tanks, could improve water availability and create a water buffer for 
dealing with successive droughts.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Artificial Recharge of Ground Water

A  typical  watershed  development  programme  has  several  components,  depending  on  the 
topography (shape, configuration and slope of the land), nature and depth of soil cover, type of rocks 
and their pattern of formation and layout, water absorbing capacity of land, rainfall intensity and 
land use. These include the following:

Contour Bunding

Contour  bunding  is  one  of  the  most  widely  practised  soil  and  water  conservation  measures, 
which controls erosion, conserves moisture, recharges groundwater and prevents silting of tanks and 
reservoirs in the downstream. The practice comprises constructing narrow-base bunds on contour 
to impound runoff water behind them, so that impounded water is absorbed gradually into the soil 
profile.

Contour bunding works are undertaken in shallow and medium soils. An area extending from the 
ridge-line (topmost line) to the valley-line (lowest line) is called a catchment. For a bunding project, 
a self-defended catchment (i.e. the topmost end of the catchment in the selected area is such that 
no water from outside the catchment drains into it) is selected. In the selected catchment, bunds are 
constructed on contours. The bunds are normally impounded upto a height of 30 cm. The spacing 
of the bund is decided based on the slope of the land and the nature of the soil. For gently sloping 
lands, with 2–3% slope, the bunds are nearly 200 feet apart. The section of a bund is also dependent 
on the value of the soil. In light soil, the section is 10 square feet, whereas in medium soil it is 24 
square feet. About 25 mm of rainwater could be stored at a soil depth of 130–150 mm for growing 
crops. On average, contour bunds had 27% higher soil moisture and 14–180% higher yield than flat 
surfaces.

Contour Trenching

This consists of excavating shallow / intermittent trenches across the land slope and forming a 
small earthen bund on the downstream side. Plantation is done on the bund to stabilize the bund. 
The trenches retain the runoff and help in the establishment of plantations made on the bund.

Trenches are useful where the land surface is fairly porous. Rainwater that gets collected in the 
trenches can quickly percolate into the ground. The spacing of trenches and their size (i.e. length, 
width and depth) should be adequate to intercept about 50% of the peak rainfall in semi-arid regions 
(annual rainfall of about 400–550 mm). The trenches should be cleaned and desilted periodically.

Contour Cultivation

Contour  operations  are  done  across  the  slope  by  cultivating  crops  and  trees  on  the  contour. 
The contour furrows created would form a multitude of mini barriers across the flow path of the 
runoff. Contour cultivation remains the most effective on moderate slopes of 2–7%. The water in 
the furrows gets collected in the depressions. Perennial grasses can be grown in such depressions. 
Another practice called strip cropping involves growing parallel rows of erosion-resistant crops to 
control loss of surface soil, with other crops grown in between.

103

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Bench Terracing

Bench  terracing  is  practised  on  steep  hilly  slopes  where  agriculture  has  replaced  natural 
forest  and grasslands since a long time. Thus, further reduction in slope length would reduce the 
intensity of runoff water. Bench terracing involves converting the original ground into level step-
like  fields  constructed by half cutting and half filling, which reduces the degree of the slope. This 
approach  of  bench  terracing  for  agro-forestry  models  is  gradually  becoming  popular  in  the  hilly 
areas of Nilgiris, north-east India and Himachal Pradesh.

Graded bunds are constructed in relatively high rainfall areas. The excess water has to be removed 
out of the field to avoid water stagnation, especially in deep black soils. These bunds are outlets for 
safe removal of water. The channels of graded bunds are wide and shallow.

Graded Bunding

Gully plugging

Gully plug, as the name implies is a small conservation structure across small gullies and streams 
in hilly areas to slow the run-off of the flowing water. Gullies result from functional disorder of the 
land, improper land use and are the most visible result of severe soil erosion. They are small drainage 
channels, which cannot be easily crossed by agricultural equipment. Gully plugging measures include 
vegetative plantings and brushwood check dams, boulder bunds, brick masonry and earthen bunds 
or a combination of both and sand bag plugs.

Check Dams / Nalla Bunding Construction

Check dam / nalla bunding work consists of construction of a masonry embankment across a 

stream or nalla with surplussing arrangement (waste weirs, at suitable intervals).

These works are undertaken to hold maximum runoff water to create temporary flooding in the 
stream with arrangements to drain water at suitable intervals. Such embankments depend on the 
slope of the nalla or off-stream and the quantity of water expected to flow. The impounding of water 
facilitates percolation of water into deeper soil and makes it possible to bring under cultivation the 
land under the bed of the nallas. The water released from these bunds is free from silt and very low in 
velocity and thus unable to cause erosion. Thus, water can be utilized optimally.

Gabion Structure

This is a commonly constructed check dam across small streams to conserve stream flows with 
practically no submergence beyond the stream course. Locally available boulders are stored in a steel 
wire. This is put up across the stream’s mesh to make a small dam by anchoring it to the streamside. 
The height of such structures is around 0.5 m and is normally used in 10–15 m wide streams. The cost 
of such structures is around Rs.10,000–15,000. The excess water overflows from this structure storing 
some water in reserve which serves as a source of recharge. The silt content of stream water in due 
course is deposited in the interstices of the boulders to make it more impermeable. These structures 
are common in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.

104

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Stream Bank Protection

Eroding stream banks not only damage adjoining agricultural lands but also contribute large 
quantities of sediment load to the river systems. Under the watershed management programme, 
bank protection of only small / minor streams is included. However, works of this nature should only 
be taken up if the benefits justify the cost of construction.

The works usually involved are that of boulder pitching on banks of about 20–30 cm thickness 
after dressing the bank to a stable slope. Where the flow velocity of the stream is high (1.5 m/sec or 
more) gabion structures should be built at the toe of the bank with the foundation firmly embedded 
in the streambed and bank.

Farm Ponds

In any watershed management programme farm ponds are an important component and useful 
in storing water for irrigation. They also retard sediment and flood flows to the downstream river 
system. In a relatively flat terrain with good soil cover, a farm pond has an earth section with usually 
3:1 side slopes on the waterside and 2:1 side slopes on the downstream face (a uniform side slope of 
2½:1 on both sides can be adopted at some sites). The sides are sodded. A natural depression nearby 
should be used as an earthen spillway with minimum channel section construction. A pipe drop inlet 
spillway and an irrigation outlet are also provided. A key trench is dug to provide good bondage 
between the original ground and the filled earth. Storm riprap against wave action may be required 
in some cases. The pond crest usually serves as a farm road (provide 4.25 m roadway for motorable 
roads).

A good pond site should possess the following traits:
 y

The site for the earthen bund should be a narrow gorge with a fan shaped valley above so that a 
small amount of earthwork provides large storage.
The drainage area above the pond should be large enough to fill the pond in 2 or 3 spells of good 
rainfall.
The pond location should be near where the water is to be used; e.g. for irrigation, it should be 
above the irrigated fields and for sediment control it should intercept the flow from the most 
erodible parts of the catchment.
The junction of two drainage channels or large natural depressions should be preferred.
The  land  surface  should  not  have  excessive  seepage  losses  unless  it  is  meant  to  serve  as  a 
percolation tank for groundwater recharge.

 y

Percolation Tanks (PT) / Spreading Basin

One  of  the  effective  measures  by  which  groundwater  recharge  can  be  achieved,  is  by  the 
construction and use of percolation tanks. The efficacy and feasibility of percolation tanks is better 
established in hard rock formation where the rocks are highly fractured and weathered.

In Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat, numerous percolation 

tanks are constructed in basaltic lava flows and crystalline rocks.

105

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Percolation tanks are constructed for very small catchments up to 10–12 sq. km., where minor 
irrigation  schemes,  bandharas  or  other  storage  schemes  are  not  technically  and  economically 
feasible.  Percolation  tank  schemes  are  intended  mainly  for  recharging  aquifers  and  improving 
the  groundwater  supply  to  the  wells  for  drinking  water  and  irrigation.  In  comparison  to  ponds, 
percolation tanks conserve water to a greater extent because the filling and recharge occur mostly 
during the monsoons when the evaporation rate is about the half of the potential rate in summer 
through which ponds contain water. Selection of a suitable site for the construction of percolation 
tanks and subsequent maintenance is crucial for its effective functioning. Where hydro-geological 
conditions are favourable, percolation rates may be increased by constructing recharge (intake) wells 
within percolation tanks.

Important Aspects of Percolation Tanks
 y

A detailed analysis of the rainfall pattern, number of rainy days, dry spells, evaporation rate and 
detailed hydro-geological studies are required to demarcate suitable percolation tank sites.
For India’s semi arid climate, the storage capacity of the percolation tank needs to be designed 
so that water percolates to the groundwater reservoir by January since the evaporation losses 
would be high subsequently.
Percolation  tanks  should  normally  be  constructed  on  second-to-third  order  streams  as  the 
catchment as well as the submergence area would be smaller. The submergence area should be 
in uncultivable land as far as possible.
Percolation tanks should be located on highly fractured and weathered rock for speedy recharge. 
In case of alluvium, bouldary formations are ideal for locating percolation tanks.
The benefited area should have sufficient number of wells and cultivable land to develop the 
recharged water.

 y Detailed hydrological studies for run off assessment should be done and design capacity should 

not normally be more than 50% of the total quantum of rainfall in the catchment.

 y Waste weir or spillway should be suitably designed to allow the flow of surplus water based on 

single day maximum rainfall after the tank is filled to its maximum capacity.
Cut off trench should be provided to minimize seepage losses both below and above the stream 
bed. To avoid erosion of the embankment due to ripple action, stone pitching should be provided 
upstream up to HFL (High Flood Line).

Anicuts

An anicut is a small water harvesting masonry dam constructed across a stream to hold sufficient 
water  and  submerge  the  upstream  area  during  the  rainy  season. The  height  of  the  anicut  above 
ground  level  is  about  22  feet.  Anicuts  are  built  to  serve  many  purposes  among  which,  recharge 
of  groundwater  in  adjacent  wells,  providing  water  for  consumption  for  animals,  for  bathing  and 
providing  a  reservoir  of  water  in  water-  scarce  years,  are  critical.  If  the  submerged  area  is  large, 
bed cultivation is practised using the stored soil profile moisture.

106

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Anicuts  are  constructed  all  over  the  country  and  are  considered  very  useful  in  those  States 
where droughts are very common. Anicut construction can be undertaken on a large-scale to seek 
community participation in watershed development and make them self-reliant in water resource 
use.

Sub-surface Barriers

A  sub-surface  barrier  is  the  most  suitable  artificial  structure  for  promoting  groundwater 
recharge. Since it is constructed below the riverbed on impervious subsurface strata, the structure 
is secure from floods, does not need elaborate overflow arrangements or periodic desilting and has 
limited evaporation. In addition, sub-surface structures do not require extensive areas of land for 
their implementation and hence have minimal ecological repercussions following their construction.

The construction of a sub-surface barrier needs a concrete or brick masonry wall, 30–60 cm wide, 
extending  down  to  the  impermeable  /  compact  basement.  A  sub-  surface  barrier  should  also  be 
constructed with angular rock pieces arranged in the form of a 100 cm wide dry masonry wall or 
with a 250-micron polyethylene sheeting, properly embedded in the soil. Some arrangement for sub-
surface outflow from the dyke is often desirable to avoid water-logging.

Two sub-surface dykes of 100 m length each, within 300 m upstream and downstream of the 
water supply well, can capture and infiltrate enough water to service potable water requirements of 
a village with a population of up to 500.

Injection Wells

Injection  wells  are  structures  similar  to  a  tube  well  but  with  the  purpose  of  augmenting  the 
groundwater  storage  of  a  confined  aquifer  by  pumping  in  treated  surface  water  under  pressure. 
Injection wells are advantageous where land is scarce.

Hydraulically, the effective induction of water in an injection well is determined by the pumping 
rate, permeability of the aquifer, distance from the stream, natural groundwater gradient and the 
type of well.

In  alluvial  areas,  an  injection  well  for  recharging  a  single  aquifer  or  multiple  aquifers  can  be 
constructed on a normal gravel packed pumping well. An injection pipe with an opening against 
the aquifer to be recharged may be sufficient. However, if there are a number of permeable zones 
separated by impervious rocks, a properly designed injection well with an inlet pipe against each 
aquifer to be recharged needs to be constructed. The injection wells as a means of artificial recharge 
are comparatively costlier and require specialized techniques of tube well construction supported by 
operation and maintenance to protect the recharge well from clogging.

Traditional Water Harvesting and Conservation

In  India,  water  harvesting  and  conservation  has  been  practised  for  a  long  time  by  local 
communities  through  traditional  methods  and  structures.  Different  eco-regions  have  their  own 
water harvesting and conservation structures, which the State Governments should aim to revive 
and rejuvenate through special schemes. Some of the important structures are discussed below:

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Dug Well Recharge

In alluvial as well as hard rocky areas, there are thousands of dug wells either gone dry or with 
declining water levels. These dug wells can be used as structures to recharge. Ground water reservoirs 
(storm water, tank water, canal water) can be diverted into these structures to directly recharge the 
dried / drying aquifer. By doing so the soil moisture losses during the normal process of artificial 
recharge are reduced.

A dry / unused well can be recharged by installing a pipe to the bottom of the dug well or below 
the water level to avoid scouring of the bottom and entrapment of air bubbles in the aquifer. The 
quality of source water including the silt content should be such that the quality of the groundwater 
in the reservoir is not deteriorated. The bottom of the dug well should be cleaned and all fine deposits 
should be removed before recharging. The recharge water should be silt-free. The well should be 
cleaned regularly and periodic chlorination should be done to prevent bacteriological contamination.

In Maharashtra, a two-pit well recharging technology has been used successfully to recharge 
dug wells. Two percolation pits are dug next to the well, one large and one small. The smaller pit 
is filled with stones, gravel and coal, which acts as a filter. A cement pipe fitted with a wire mesh 
filter is fixed at the bottom of the smaller pit. This pipe opens into the well. Rainwater that collects 
in the larger pit, flows into the smaller pit and is filtered before it flows into the well through the 
pipe. The silt that accumulates in the pits can be used in the fields. In this way, soil is conserved as 
well.
Village Pond / Tank

Village ponds / tanks are the most commonly used method to collect and store rainwater. Most 
ponds have their own catchments, which provide requisite quantity of water during the rainy season. 
Where the catchments are too small to provide enough water, water from nearby streams is diverted 
through open channels to fill the ponds. In some places water from irrigation canals is also used to 
fill ponds.

Ponds  are  excavated  in  different  shapes  and  sizes  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  terrain, 
availability of land and water requirements of the village community. Pond water is available for 2 
months to a year after the rains, depending on the catchment characteristics and the amount and 
intensity of rainfall. Ponds / tanks are known by different names in different regions (Table 15).

Tankas / Kunds / Kundis

In the desert and arid areas of Rajasthan people build unique underground structures of various 
shapes and sizes to collect rainwater for drinking purposes. These structures called tankas, kunds 
or kundis are constructed in a variety of places, such as courtyards, in front of houses and temples, 
in open agricultural fields, barren lands. These are built both for individual households as well as 
for village communities using locally available materials. While some structures are built in stone 
masonry with stone slab coverings, others are built with only rudimentary plastering of bare soil 
surfaces of the tank with cement or lime and covered with Zizyphus numularia thorns. Some “kuccha” 
structures have a convex covering of local wood with mud plaster. Inlet holes are provided in the 
convex side at the ground level to facilitate entry of rainwater into the tank. In “pucca” structures (e.g. 
tanka) the wall of the tank is projected above the ground to provide inlet holes.

Since tankas are the main source of drinking water in these areas, people zealously protect and 
maintain them. Just before the onset of the monsoons, the catchment area of the tanka is cleaned up 
to remove all possible pollutants, and human activity and grazing of cattle in the area is prohibited. 
Even  though  the  average  annual  rainfall  in  these  areas  varies  from  200  mm  to  300  mm  with  the 
minimum as low as 120 mm, these structures provide enough drinking water to tide over the water 
scarce summer months. In many, the stored water lasts for the whole year. These simple traditional 
water harvesting structures are useful even during years of below-normal rainfall.

Khadin

The  khadin,  a  runoff  farming  and  groundwater  recharging  system,  is  popular  in  hyper-  arid 
parts of Rajasthan. Its main feature is a very long (100–300 m) earthen embankment built across the 
lower hill slopes lying below gravel uplands. Sluices and spillways allow excess water to drain off. 
The khadin system is based on the principle of harvesting rainwater on farmland and subsequent 
use of this water-saturated land for crop production. A khadin farm is developed based on rainfall 
probability, available catchment area and its runoff generation potential. Apart from the submerged 
area, khadin beds are cultivated from top to bottom, the line of receding moisture. Ponding of water 
in a khadin induces continuous groundwater recharge.

Vav / Vavdi / Baoli / Bavadi / Jhalara

These  are  traditional  stepwells  in  Rajasthan  and  northern  India.  Often  rectangular  in  design, 
these structures have steps on three or four sides.These ancient water harvesting systems collect 
subterranean seepage of a talab or a lake located upstream. They were mainly set up by the nobility in 
cities and big towns to provide water supply to the community. They were constructed at exorbitant 
cost and were often monumental, with fine stone work covering large areas and were associated with 
religion and culture.

Hill Slope Collection

This system is common in many hilly areas with good rainfall (in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, 
Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh). It consists of lined channels that are built across the hill slopes to 
intercept rainwater. These channels convey water for irrigating terraced agricultural fields. The water 
is also used to fill small ponds for domestic use and for cattle.

Spring Water Harvesting

In the Lahaul and Spiti areas of Himachal Pradesh, water from hill streams are diverted through 
small excavated channels, called kuls, for domestic use and irrigation. In Jammu region these are 
called kuhals. This practice can also be seen in Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, 
Sikkim and Darjeeling area of West Bengal. Where the springs are merely in the form of water trickling 
through layers and joints in rocks, split bamboo channels are used to trap and convey water up to the 
village / hamlet for drinking purposes.

Rainwater Harvesting in Urban Areas

Rainwater harvesting involves the collection, storage and distribution of rainwater from the roof, 
for use inside and outside the home or business. In most urban centres, rainwater harvesting has 
become necessary to address the acute water scarcity, which they experience and the flooding during 
short spells of heavy rainfall. Most of the rain falling on the surface tends to flow away rapidly leaving 
very little for recharge of groundwater. Capturing the runoff is therefore an important solution to the 
worsening urban water situation.

Rainwater harvesting has several benefits. It helps in utilizing the primary source of water, and 
prevents the runoff from going into sewers or storm drains, thereby reducing the load on treatment 
plants. It also reduces urban flooding and by recharging water into the aquifers, helps in improving 
the quality of existing groundwater through dilution.

Rainwater harvesting can be harvested from the following surfaces:
Rooftops: If buildings with impervious roofs are already in place, the catchment area is effectively 

available free of charge and can provide enough supply.

Paved  and  unpaved  areas:  Landscapes,  open  fields,  parks,  stormwater  drains,  roads  and 
pavements and other open areas can be effectively used to harvest the runoff. The main advantage 
in using the ground as a collecting surface is that water can be collected from a larger area. This is 
particularly advantageous in areas with low rainfall.

Waterbodies:  The  potential  of  lakes,  tanks  and  ponds  to  store  rainwater  is  immense.  The 
harvested rainwater not only meets the water requirements of the city, it also recharges groundwater 
aquifers.

Storm  water  drains:  Most  of  the  residential  colonies  have  a  proper  network  of  stormwater 

drains. If maintained neatly, these offer a simple and cost-effective means for harvesting rainwater.

The  decision  on  whether  to  store  or  recharge  water  depends  on  the  rainfall  pattern  and  the 
potential to do so, in a particular region. The sub-surface geology also plays an important role in 
making this decision.

110

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

For example, in Delhi, Rajasthan and Gujarat where the total annual rainfall occurs during 3 or 
4 months, are examples of places where groundwater recharge is usually practised. In places such 
as Kerala, Mizoram, Tamil Nadu and Bengaluru where rain falls throughout the year barring a few 
dry  periods,  a  small-sized  tank  for  storing  rainwater  is  enough,  since  the  period  between  two 
spells  of  rain  is  short.  Wherever  sub-strata  are  impermeable,  recharging  would  not  be  feasible. 
Hence, it would be ideal to opt for storage.

Features of Roofwater Harvesting Systems

Rainwater is clean and can usually be used for drinking and domestic purposes without filtering, 
depending on the cleanliness of the roof and storage system. In many cities, it is now mandatory for 
the residents to install roofwater harvesting systems with the following main features:

 y

 y
 y

 y

 y

 y

Basic requirements: a roof (preferably rectangular), gutters, down pipe, cement base and storage 
system. Corrugated iron or tiled roof preferable, but closely packed thatching also works (do not 
use asbestos). Low cost guttering systems can be made from split bamboo.
Storage systems range from earthenware jars to large tanks of 30,000 litres capacity.
Below ground storage systems: generally are cheaper to construct because of the support of the 
sidewalls but they require a pump to lift the water and are more difficult to clean.
Partial below ground systems: a circular hole is dug into the ground and lined with polyethylene 
or concrete plastering. It is covered with a roof (from thatch or iron sheets) to protect the water 
from sunlight, birds and animals.
Above  ground  storage:  constructed  from  curved  galvanised  sheets,  ferro-cement  or  bricks  to 
form a round tank. This system does not require a pump, cleaning is easier and leaks can be 
detected easily. A concrete base is desirable.
Storage systems should prevent mosquitoes entering and breeding in the water, and prevent 
sunlight that stimulates algae growth. Easy access to all storage systems is necessary for periodic 
cleaning. A first flush system can be incorporated to flush away the first rainwater which has 
dislodged leaves and dirt after a long dry spell.
Amount of water collected: A house with a 7 m x 7 m roof can capture 500 litres of water from 10 
mm of rainfall. An area with an annual rainfall of 750 mm and a 75% efficient well designed and 
constructed system, yields 28,000 litres per year. If an average family consumes 100 litres per day 
then there is enough water for 280 days (assuming there is sufficient storage).

Water Saving Technologies: Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation Systems

State Governments are encouraging adoption of water-saving technologies, such as sprinkler 
and drip irrigation systems, through provision of subsidies to the farmers on the purchase of these 
systems. These technologies are recommended for achieving higher irrigation efficiencies and could 
be used for very small-sized holdings.

While  sprinklers  require  energized  pump  sets,  microtube  drips  can  work  under  a  very  low-
pressure head, with as little as a bucket full of water. Sprinklers tend to irrigate more uniformly than 
gravity systems and therefore efficiencies typically average about 70%. But in windy and dry areas 

111

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

much water can be lost due to evaporation in this system. The sprinkler system is particularly effective 
in sandy undulating terrain. For fruits, vegetables and orchard crops, drip irrigation (also known as 
trickle irrigation) is more suitable.

These  systems  require    much  less    maintenance  when    compared  with  the  conventional 
pressurized irrigation systems.The ease of maintenance is more significant in microtube drip systems. 
However, the adoption of these technologies by poor farmers would depend heavily on the supply of 
information, materials and services for installation.

Improved Water Saving Farm Practices

It is necessary to adopt farm practices which can progressively reduce the water requirement of 
existing crops and improve primary productivity of the cultivated land. Such practices are particularly 
important for semi-arid regions which have already taken to intensive farming with irrigation water, 
both from canals and aquifers. These practices include the increased use of organic manure with the 
gradual reduction of chemical fertilizers, vermin-culture and agronomic practices, such as mulching, 
crop rotation and the use of biopest control measures. Organic manure can help regain structure and 
texture of soils and enhance their moisture retention capacity along with improving soil nutrients. 
Use of farm management practices, such as mulching, can reduce evaporation from the soil surface, 
thereby increasing the efficiency of irrigation water utilization.

Long-term Irrigation Management

A  long-term  strategy  is  required  for  managing  water  resources  through  irrigation  projects  in 
India. It consists of several measures which would expand the area under irrigation and reduce the 
incidence of drought. All State Governments need to develop policies and procedures for utilization 
of  irrigation  resources.  The  State  irrigation  department  should  formulate  long-term  policies  and 
management practices for the use of irrigation resources. The important elements of these policies 
and management practices are listed below:

Monitoring Reservoirs: It is necessary for the State irrigation department to set up a monitoring 
system for water stored in reservoirs, exercise appropriate control on releases of water from these 
reservoirs  and  plan  for  judicious  use  of  water  resources. The  State  irrigation  department  should 
prepare a water budget for every reservoir covering drinking water, kharif / rabi requirements and 
evaporation  losses.  Many  details  of  reservoir  management  have  been  discussed  in  the  chapter 
on water resource management in the previous chapter.

Setting  up  Water  Users  Association:  State  Governments  should  provide  incentives  for 
setting up Water Users Association (WUA) to involve communities in the management of irrigation 
resources. WUAs  should  be  formed  at  the  minor  canal  level  (average  command  of  500  hectares). 
The responsibility for maintaining the minor and smaller channels can be entrusted with the WUAs. 
The State irrigation department should charge WUAs on the basis of the volume of water actually 
taken. Incentives for setting up WUAs could be provided to the farmers by relaxing designated crop 
restrictions and restrictions on conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, channel repairs, rebates 
for prompt payment of irrigation fees, volumetric fees lower than crop-area fees and maintenance 
grants.

112

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Conjunctive  Use  of  Surface  and  Groundwater: This  concept  is  very  essential,  especially  in 
drought areas to increase the production per unit of water. It allows flexibility in cropping patterns 
and multi-cropping in the canal command. For proper water management it is necessary to treat 
the command areas as one composite unit and the two resources managed judiciously to achieve 
optimal benefits. This concept use has been successfully implemented in various States. Conjunctive 
use of surface and groundwater supplies needs careful planning on more scientific lines to achieve 
full benefits.

Prevention of Evaporation Losses from Reservoirs: Shallow tanks having large surface areas 
located in the drought-affected regions lose nearly half the volume of stored water by evaporation 
during  the  summer  months. The  evaporation  is  quite  high  (250  cm  or  more)  in  West  Rajasthan, 
Saurashtra,  Deccan  Plateau  and  Southern  Coastal  regions  of Tamil  Nadu.  In  these  areas  use  of  a 
chemical retardant to minimize evaporation losses may be economically viable. A layer of chemicals 
like cetyl, steary and fatty alcohol emulsions when applied on the water surface can help reduce 
evaporation. It has been reported that fatty alcohol emulsions can effectively retard evaporation, 
saving around 40% of the normal evaporation losses. However, such measures may be considered 
after  suitable  bio-degradability  study  and  bio-hazard  assessment,  and  after  necessary  approvals 
from pollution control and other regulatory authorities.

Increasing Storages through Expeditious Completion of Irrigation Projects: Water storage 
capacity in the States could be increased through expeditious completion of irrigation projects. Many 
States that started a large number of irrigation projects, could not complete them due to inadequate 
resources. States should seek resources through the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) 
of the Government of India for completing these projects and increasing the area under irrigation.

 Integrating Small Reservoirs with Major Reservoirs: As large dams are difficult to construct 
due to high costs and large-scale displacement of people, there is an increased emphasis on creating 
small reservoirs. A number of small reservoirs could be created to replace a single large reservoir. 
However, in  many  cases a  group of small schemes  may not provide the  same benefits as a  large 
project can. It is, therefore, very important that minor schemes are integrated with the canal systems 
of major reservoirs.

Integrated  Basin  Planning:  This  concept  is  aimed  at  coordinating  water  resources  plans 
throughout a river basin, the most important example of which is the Tennessee Valley Authority in 
the USA. In India, the Damodar Valley Corporation covering the river Damodar and its tributaries in 
Bihar and West Bengal was modeled on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority.

The philosophy of river basin development, however, underwent significant changes during the 
latter half of the twentieth century. In 1950, the construction of multiple-purpose dams and other 
engineering works along a river’s main channel was central to the concept. The region benefited 
through  navigation,  flood  control,  hydropower  generation  and  distribution,  and  agricultural 
development.  By  the  end  of  the  century,  however,  the  concept  shifted  and  broadened  and  laid 
emphasis on the values of biodiversity, nonstructural means of improved water management and 
stakeholder  participation  in  watershed-level  initiatives.  All  States  need  to  adopt  integrated  basin 
planning for addressing wide-ranging issues of natural resource management.

Inter-basin  Transfer  of  Water:  The  permanent  long-term  solution  to  the  drought  problem 
may be found in the basic principles of transfer of power from surplus river basins to the areas of 

113

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

deficit. Many basins in the country have surplus water resources while others face serious shortages. 
Creation of storages and inter-basin transfer of water from surplus to deficit regions could therefore 
be an option for achieving more equitable distribution and optimal utilization of water resources. It 
has been argued that a National Water Grid could be set up by linking resource abundant rivers such 
as the Brahmaputra and Ganga with other rivers. Long distance water transfer is not a new concept 
in India. There are a number of canals, such as the Western Yamuna Canal and Agra Canal in north 
India,  and  the  Kurnool–Cuddapah  Canal  and  the  Periyar–Vaigai  Canal  in  south  India,  which  have 
carried water for long distances and irrigated water deficient areas. However, these projects would 
require huge commitment of resources as well as popular support across the States, and would call 
for extensive studies related to environment impact and benefit-cost analyses.

Afforestation

It  is  well-known  that  the  development  of  forests  in  areas,  which  are  susceptible  to  periodic 
recurrence of drought, is indeed a very effective drought-resistant measure. Areas which are devoid 
of tree growth suffer serious erosion and need to be covered with vegetation in the shortest possible 
time with a view to mitigate drought conditions.

Drought-affected areas have vast expanses devoid of vegetation, depleted of tree growth and 
exposed parent rocks and boulders. The accelerated run-off in these areas is so large that all the 
surrounding agricultural land cannot even support marginal or subsistence agriculture. To remedy 
this,  vegetation  on  hill  slopes,  catchments  and  other  vulnerable  areas  need  to  be  undertaken, 
particularly where rainfall is low. Plantation and green cover may be encouraged to help check soil 
erosion and the use of organic compost and bio-degradable mulching will enable the absorption 
and retainment of minerals for long time  thereby reducing the risk of leaching.

Trees and vegetation not only protect the soil, improve its water holding capacity, minimize run-
off, regulate drainage (both surface and underground), but also preserve and improve the productive 
capacity of the soil and fertility of agricultural land in the vicinity. The foliage produced any effective 
vegetation, whether trees, shrubs, bushes or even well-pastured grass, forms a sheltering shield or 
canopy which breaks down the intensity of torrential rain and thus reduces its erosive action on the 
soil. Furthermore, when this water with reduced velocity reaches down, it does not flow down to the 
rivers but is absorbed due to the vegetation and helps recharge ground and surface water resulting 
in  the  creation  of  perennial  rather  than  seasonal  storage  in  the  reservoirs.  Therefore,  multi-tier 
plantation of grasses, bushes, shrubs and trees of local multipurpose varieties should be promoted 
as these are more tolerant to temperature / climatic conditions.

Before  the  afforestation  programme  is  taken  up,  a  thorough  inspection  and  classification  of 
the areas needs to be conducted. The land identified for afforestation should be divided into three 
categories: (i) areas with adequate depth of soil to make afforestation feasible; (ii) areas with shallow 
soils fit for supporting grass and shrub growth but not fit for tree growth; (iii) badly degraded and 
eroded  areas  unfit  for  tree  growth  and  shrubs  and  where  only  soil  and  moisture  conservation 
operations should be carried out.

In drought-prone areas, planting of drought-resistant varieties of trees should be considered. 
Fruit trees, such as sitafal (annona squamosa) and drought-resistant fodder species, may not only 
be useful as an afforestation measure, but also enable the supply of fodder to the cattle. Different 

114

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

species of bushes and shrubs should be planted, which not only prevent soil erosion but also provide 
a leaf-hedge against cattle and barrier against fire when planted like a boundary or fence.

Afforestation  should  be  financially  supported  through  the  social  forestry  and  watershed 
development programmes which normally carry budgetary provisions for this activity. Assistance 
from  the  Sub-Mission  on  Agro-forestry  will  help  to  promote  peripheral  boundary  plantation,  low 
density block plantation and high density block plantation.  Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) can play 
a critical role in the expansion and sustainability of activities.

Crop insurance 

Farmers from drought risk regions may be encouraged to subscribe to the crop insurance for 
reducing  the  risk.  Awareness  building  programmes  may  be  undertaken  to  increase  the  farmer 
participation in the crop insurance.          

Community Participation in Drought Mitigation

Community  participation  is  an  essential  feature  of  drought  mitigation  programmes.  As  local 
water  management  and  rainwater  harvesting  hold  the  key  to  drought  mitigation,  Government 
policies  should  emphasize  community-based  water  resource  management.  Community-based 
institutions,  such  as  WUAs,  can  play  important  roles  in  managing  water  resources  at  the  micro 
level. The Prime Minister's Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) and Pilot Unified Package Insurance Scheme 
may be promoted vigorously in drought affected districts

Build  on  Micro-level  Experiences:  The  villages  of  Sukhomajri  in  Haryana  and  about  100 
communities  in  Alwar  have  improved  their  socio-economic  conditions  through  community-led 
water management. These communities used traditional water harvesting structures, such as village 
tanks and johads, which increased the groundwater table in the area, resulting in increased water 
storage and substantial increase in crop production and resultant income. Ralegan Siddhi and Hirve 
bazar from Ahmednagar district are the other successful examples of community-based initiatives in 
water resource management. These micro-level success stories need to be spread to other parts of 
the country for other communities to replicate.

Institutions: 

Several  models  of 

Innovate  Community-based 

community-based 
institutions  have  emerged,  which  are  effectively  managing  surface  and  groundwater. 
In 
Odisha,  the  ‘Pani  Panchayat  programme’  assigns  various  roles  to  the  community  and  the 
local  self-government 
in  water  management  and  is  preparing  community-based  drought 
management  plans.  In  Ozhar,  Maharashtra  WUAs  are  enabling  farmers  to  manage  irrigation 
water.  In  Banikhet,  Himachal  Pradesh  the  lift  irrigation  project  deals  with  various  aspects  of 
water  use,  such  as  water  charges, 
In  Rajasthan,  communities  are 
participating  in  checks  on  rainwater  loss  and  thus  ensuring  the  enhancement  of  groundwater. 
State Governments need to build on these examples and encourage the formation of community-
based organizations for effective management of water resources.

local  maintenance. 

As discussed above, State Governments need to encourage the formation of WUAs for community-
based management of water delivery system. Maharashtra has taken the lead in 1990 in forming 
WUAs, and its State Government has handed over the management of the entire irrigation systems 
of Niphad block, where the irrigation dam is situated, to the WUA network. WUA-like initiatives have 

115

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

been launched in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, which also 
suffer from water scarcity. Legislations dealing with transferring of water management to WUA- like 
groups are being formulated in all these States.

Organize  Community-based  Consultations  through  Gram  Sabha:  Community-based 
consultations refer to community decisions, collective contribution, self- regulations, and negotiations 
with  the  Government  conducted  through  Gram  Sabhas,  in  particular  and  PRIs  in  general. These 
processes can be very important for the management of water, fodder and crops at the community-
level. Further, these processes can also lead to meeting the basic entitlements through provision of 
work and food to people affected by drought.

Strengthen Women’s Self-help Groups: Self-help groups empower women and help them to 
access resources. Women start economic activities and generate an independent stream of income. 
While  it  has  an  empowering  impact  on  women,  it  also  increases  resilience  of  the  households  in 
responding  to  drought. Those  households  who  depend  solely  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihoods 
suffer  badly  due  to  income  and  consumption  losses,  while  diversified  households  cope  with  the 
impact better. These self-help groups could be formed and strengthened through many interventions 
at the community level.

Women’s self-help groups can play an important role in a large number of measures targeted at 
drought mitigation. They could be involved in rainwater harvesting, running PDS shops, Aanganwadis 
and  day  care  centres  and  overseeing  water  distribution  and  utilization  in  their  community.  Since 
women are the most affected in a drought situation, they could plan several measures that reduce 
their  hardships  and  promote  greater  equity  and  efficiency  in  natural  resource  management. 
Women’s self-help groups could also come forward in addressing special needs of certain groups, 
such as pregnant women, school-going children and the old and disabled people. During a drought 
situation, the well being of these groups can only be ensured through the active support of women’s 
groups.

  Empower  Panchayati  Raj  Institutions:  Several  drought  relief  and  mitigation  measures 
could  be  implemented  through  the  PRIs  more  effectively. The  necessary  budget  allocations  and 
implementation  support  should  be  provided  to  these  institutions  for  launching  programmes  in 
drought-affected areas. PRIs improve the delivery mechanism and reduce the impact of drought. The 
examples of several droughts have shown the importance of involving these institutions in drought 
management.

Climate Variability and Adaptation

Climate variability refers to the climatic parameter of a region varying from its long- term mean. 
Every year in a specific time period, the climate of a location is different. Some years have below 
average rainfall, some have average or above average rainfall. Due to the phenomenon of climate 
change affecting India, such variability would have an impact on agriculture. As a result of variability, 
the hydrological cycle is likely to be altered and the severity of droughts and intensity of floods in 
various parts of India is likely to increase. Further, a general reduction in the quantity of available 
run-off is predicted. Simulations using dynamic crop models indicate a decrease in yield of crops as 
temperature increases in different parts of India.

116

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Incidence of pests and diseases may increase with climate variability and climate change. With 
long dry spells and more intense rainfall, the resulting decline in water quality will lead to greater 
risk of water-borne diseases. Changing temperatures and rainfall in drought-prone areas are likely to 
shift populations of insect pests and other vectors and change the incidence of existing vector-borne 
diseases in both humans and crops.

Livelihood activities that rely on sensitive agricultural systems will be more vulnerable to climate 
change. Trends such as population growth, pollution, increasing demand for food and water and 
market fluctuations can compound the impact of climate variability and climate change.

Adaptation  to  climate  variability  is  a  process  of  practising  the  cultivation  methods  to 

moderate, cope with or take advantage of the consequences of climatic events.

Adaptation options need to benefit the community and ensure community participation so that 
experiences of local-level adaptation strategies can be shared. To implement adaptation measures 
in the agriculture sector, it is necessary to understand the potential impacts of climate change and 
local perceptions. The basic understanding in the context of climate change adaptation in drought-
prone areas is that the adaptation option should have the potential to improve the livelihood assets 
(human, natural, financial, physical and social) of rural people.

Through efforts to determine the viability of adaptation options, it is actually possible to create 
a  menu  of  adaptation  options  for  the  development  planning  process  with  the  potential  to  be 
integrated  into  the  existing institutional  agenda. Short-term  cropping,  inter-cropping,  small-scale 
fodder cultivation, small-scale fish cultivation in mini-ponds, homestead gardens and farm ponds for 
rainwater harvesting are some of the examples of adaptation practices that can be adopted at the 
local  level.  These  livelihood  practices,  which  improve  the  adaptive  capacity  of  the  farmers,  are 
likely to be a regular feature of the drought management programme.

Power supply in vulnerable area

States  may  take  necessary  actions  to  ensure  quality  power  supply  in  the  areas  vulnerable 
drought. Structural measures for power distribution need to be implemented in a systematic manner.

Public Distribution System (PDS)

The Public Distribution supply chain and Fair Price Shops should be fully geared to deal with a 
drought situation. The State Government/District Administration should carry out regular inspections 
to ensure that distribution of ration is not hampered in any way.  

Crop management practices 

Cultivation  of  drought  resistant  crops  and  crop  varieties  followed  by  scientific  management 
practices  would  lead  to  drought  proofing  over  a  period  of  time.  The  State  departments  should 
encourage farmers adopt better crop management practices from time to time.

Indigenous knowledge

increase the drought resistance.

Traditional  knowledge  and  local  practices  need  to  be  fully  exploited  and  implemented  to 

117

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Documentation of best practices

The  best  practices  in  drought  mitigation  implemented  in  different  parts  of  the  State  need 
to  documented  and  showcased  to  all  the  stakeholders  in  order  to  achieve  large  scale  use  of 
such  practices.

Awareness and Capacity building

Campaigns  to  build  awareness  on  drought  mitigation  methods  and  programmes  to  build 
the  capacities  of  farmers  and  village  level  functionaries  would  be  of  immense  use  for  efficient 
implementation of different measures of drought proofing.

Monitoring of Drought Mitigation

The  State  Government  /State  Executive  Committee  (SEC)  may  consider  periodic  review  of 
the  progress  of  drought  mitigation  activities  of  different  departments.  The  SEC  should  cause 
the formulation of holistic drought mitigation plans at least for vulnerable districts, if not for sub 
divisions/Mandals etc. Such plans will help sharpen the focus on mitigation measures and gain from 
the synergies being brought in by line departments. 

Drought Vulnerability and  Risk mapping

Drought vulnerability and risk maps are useful to prioritize the areas for convergence of drought 

mitigation measures. 

Vulnerability  assessment  studies  should  examine  livelihood  patterns,  impact  on  income  and 
consumption, social capital, migration and social security system, which influence the vulnerability 
of people. Such an assessment would be necessary to suggest measures for watershed management, 
irrigation  efficiency, ap propriate ag ricultural pr actices an d cr opping ch oices pa ttern, wa ter 
conservation  etc.,  new  risk  management  measures.  NRSC  (ISRO)  has  developed  agricultural 
drought  vulnerability  assessment  methodology  by  including  weather,  soil,  crop  and  socio-
economic  indicators  and  generated  sub-district  level  vulnerability  maps  for  Andhra  Pradesh, 
Telangana  and  Haryana  states.    The  study  reports  are  available  at  www.nrsc.gov.in.  The  States 
may  take  the  assistance  of  Scientific institutions in the mapping of drought vulnerability and risks. 
However, to begin with, the districts having encountered large number of droughts in the past 15 
years can be justifiably selected for vulnerability assessment.

The  mission  /  task  force  should  also  prioritize  programmes  that  include  the  completion  of 
unfinished  irrigation  and  watershed  development  projects,  ground  and  surface  water  and 
regulatory  framework  for  improved  use  conservation  of  natural  resources  for  reducing  the 
drought risk. 

Decision Support System for Drought Management

Development  of  a  decision  support  system  for  drought  management  would  streamline  the 
implementation  of  the  drought  mitigation  activities.  Establishing  automated  weather  stations 
and rain gauges to improve the collection of information, promote the use of data related to soil, 
vegetation and water resource obtained through remote sensing technology and actively support 
research on climate and natural resource management are some of the initiatives to strengthen the 
drought mitigation endeavours. Such information provides more analytical tools for understanding 
drought and making informed policy choices for drought mitigation.

 States may network with all the established research institutions at the national level dealing 
with remote sensing satellite data, dryland agriculture and natural resource management to acquire 
necessary technical expertise for handing drought mitigation measures. 

Impact Assessment and evaluation 

Drought mitigation measures have been in existence for a long time, but the complexity and 

dynamics of the calamity are equally daunting. 

States should therefore consider evolving mechanisms for monitoring and impact assessment 
of  drought  mitigation  programmes/activities.  It  is  suggested  to  take  up  household  survey    with 
properly designed  questionnaire  to  capture  the  effectiveness    of  drought  mitigation  measures. 
The  impact  assessment and evaluation of response system is suggested to be taken up at regular 
intervals.
Promote Education and Awareness of Mitigation Policies and Measures

Encourage education and awareness programmes on drought mitigation issues. People must 
be informed of the importance of water conservation and harvesting, optimal water use and the 
need for increasing forest cover. A wide public awareness about the importance of natural resource 
management is a very important aspect of a long-term drought mitigation programme.

Bring together policymakers and scientific experts for developing feasible and practical public 
policies and encourage academic research on the key indicators of drought.  It should be extremely 
helpful if academic institutions are asked to participate actively in drought mitigation programmes.

Encourage Community-level Plans for Drought Mitigation

The States should consider involving community institutions actively in drought mitigation and 

to build public awareness. 

The States should provide necessary policy, programme, and financial support to the PRIs for 
drought mitigation. A large number of programmes are being implemented through the PRIs and 
it is necessary that these institutions are sensitive to the drought mitigation issues. Though the PRIs 
are generally very active in monitoring local interventions, there is a need for greater sensitization of 
the drought risks. 

120

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

All over the country, self-help groups are being set up, seeking the participation of women in 
large numbers. Women bear a disproportionate share of the consequences of drought and, therefore, 
it would be fruitful to initiate an active dialogue with women Self Help Groups (SHGs) on drought 
mitigation strategy based on conservation and optimal use of water. The mission / task force should 
consider encouraging self-help groups to take up drought mitigation programs and for that these 
groups should be allowed access to resources, knowledge and information.

The States should consider involving NGOs and community-based organizations in implementing 
the drought mitigation strategy. Several Government programmes in soil and water conservation 
and water supply are being implemented through NGOs. The mission / task force should recommend 
implementing these programmes in a more integrated manner for effective drought mitigation.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Annex 2 : Drought Monitoring Centres Mandate and Organization

Background

At present, the Ministries / Departments responsible for drought management at the National 
and State levels get inadequate technical support for drought early warning and monitoring. It has a 
serious impact on the timelines and scale of operations for drought management.

The Government of Karnataka set up a Drought Monitoring Cell in the year 1988. This institution 
has  taken  a  lead  in  monitoring  and  managing  the  recurring  drought situation in the State on a 
scientific basis. Drought Monitoring Cell is thus considered to be  a  success  in  terms  of  knowledge 
management and decision support system. 

The Drought Monitoring Centre (DMC) would monitor all the indices and indicators of  drought 
on  a  scientific  basis  and  provide  technical  advice  to  the  Government.  It  would  interact  with 
multiple National and State-level scientific institutions, Ministries and Departments, obtain relevant 
information related to different aspects of drought, and assist the Government in the management 
of drought relief and mitigation.

Objectives

The objectives of DMC at the National and State levels are as follows:

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 
e. 

f. 

g. 

To  act  as  the  scientific  and  technical  advisor  to  the  Government  on  all  aspects  of drought 
management;
To undertake studies and research on various scientific and technical issues related to drought 
management;
To  develop  a  database  on  various  drought  related  indices  and  indicators; precipitation, 
evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, surface water bodies, land use, soils and forest cover;
To provide drought early warning information to the Government and other stakeholders;
To  develop  short-term  and  long-term  drought  mitigation  measures  and  recommend 
them to the various institutions and farmers;
To develop a network of various resources and user agencies so that the information and  database 
management could be strengthened through collective inputs of these agencies; and
To  initiate,  support  and  coordinate  applied  research  programs  in  universities  and  other 
institutions related to drought monitoring and mitigation.

Activities

activities are as follows:

DMC would conduct a number of core activities in relation to drought management. These  core 

(i) 

Build  and  Maintain  a  Database  on  Drought  Indices  and  Indicators:  DMC  would regularly 
collect and analyze data of various indicators of drought such as rainfall, land  use  patterns, 
agricultural conditions, groundwater and surface water levels, and socio-economic conditions 

142

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

such as migration, distress sale of assets, etc. Such a  database  would  be  maintained  on  GIS 
platforms, and be accessible to all the users.

(iii) 

(ii)  Preparation  and  Issuance  of  Periodical  Reports  on  Drought:  DMC  would  prepare  and 
disseminate reports prepared on daily, weekly, monthly, seasonally, and annual basis on different 
aspects  of  drought  management.  It  would  include  reports  on  rainfall,  various  stages  of 
agricultural operations, crop conditions, reservoir levels, fodder, and drinking water situations.
Inter-disciplinary Studies on Drought Management: DMC would support inter- disciplinary 
studies  on  drought  management  to  develop  a  knowledge-based  public  policy  on  drought 
management.  It  would  combine  aspects  of  climate  change,  meteorology,  agriculture, 
irrigation,  water  conservation,  and  coping  strategies adopted by the people. Such studies 
would  provide  insights  into  natural  resource management,  and  suggest  feasible  mitigation 
measures.

(iv)  Maintenance  and  Operation  of  a Weather  Stations  Network: DMC  may  consider setting  up 
telemetric rain gauges / weather stations in the state, maintaining the network, and improving 
the database on climate and rainfall.

DMC’s subsidiary activities are described as follows:

(i) 

Satellite-based  drought  monitoring  in  collaboration  with  National  Remote  Sensing  Centre 
(NRSC), Hyderabad through obtaining vegetation index

(ii)  Crop yield estimation in collaboration with Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad 

and other agriculture-related institutions

Impact assessment of watershed development programs

(iii)  Water balance studies and preparation of Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI)
(iv)  Crop water budgeting studies for the districts and Talukas / Tehsils / blocks, crop- wise
(v) 
(vi)  Standardization of average rainfall for all the Talukas / Tehsils / blocks and districts
(vii)  Assist the Government in the processes leading to the declaration of drought
(viii)  Assist  the  Government  in  preparation  of  loss  estimates  due  to  drought  and  preparation  of 

Memorandum for submission to the Government of India

(ix)  Documentation of drought management efforts
(x)  Advise the Government on different aspects of water and soil management

Organizational Set up

The  State  DMC  should  be  headed  by  the  Relief  Commissioner  and  have  a  complement  of 
technical experts related to agriculture, meteorology, remote sensing, hydrology and related fields on 
a permanent or deputation/ contractual basis.  It should have a well defined office with appropriate 
staff and equipment.

MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT

Annex 4: Preparation of Memorandum to Government of India for 

Assistance from the NDRF (National Disaster Response Fund)

State Governments submit Memorandum to the Central Government, in Ministry of Agriculture 
and Farmers Welfare, seeking assistance for drought relief from the National Disaster Response Fund 
(NDRF). The Memorandum is submitted after the State Government formally declares drought.

It is recommended that the Memorandum is precise containing all relevant details related to 
intra-seasonal  variation  in  rainfall,  crop  condition,  food-grain  prices,  availability  of  fodder,  water 
crisis, fire incidences, migration, sale of assets, withdrawal of children from schools, etc. and details of 
relief employment, provision and distribution of foodgrains, supply of drinking water, cattle camps 
and  fodder  depots,  and  any  other  relief  measure  organized  by  the  State  Government  and  other 
organizations, along with expenditures incurred by the State Government.

The Memorandum will clearly specify if the drought is of the ‘Severe’ category and for assistance 
shall mandatorily be accompanied by details of the key indicators of drought as specified in Table 
3.11 and village-wise field verification data table as referred to in 3.5.1 in Chapter 3 in the National 
Drought Management Manual. 

The second part of Memorandum may provide details. The section may also provide information 

on other indicators of drought: 

The Memorandum should provide the details of assistance requested from the NDRF. Such a 
request needs to be framed necessarily in accordance with the guidelines prescribed for the NDRF 
and supported by necessary details.  Information on the expenditures incurred through the SDRF, 
and the balances available with the SDRF should also be mentioned.  Request should not be made 
for items  not covered under the extant norms.
