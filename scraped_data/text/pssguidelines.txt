PRICE SUPPORT SCHEME (PSS): THE OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES 

CHAPTER – I 

INTRODUCTION 

Assurance  of  a  remunerative  and  stable  price  environment  for  growers/farmers  is  very 

important  for  increasing  agricultural  production  and  productivity.  The  market  price  for 

agricultural produce many times tends to be unstable and volatile which may result into undue 

losses to the growers and discourage adoption of the modern technology and required inputs.  

The  Government’s  price  policy 

for  agricultural  commodities  seeks 

to  ensure 

remunerative  prices  to  the  growers  for  their  produce  with  a  view  to  encourage  higher 

investment  and  production  and  to  safeguard  the  interest  of  consumers  by  making  available 

supplies at reasonable prices  with low cost  of intermediation.   The price policy also seeks to 

evolve a balanced and integrated price structure in the perspective of the overall needs of the 

economy.  

Towards  this  end,  the  Government  announces,  Minimum  Support  Prices  (MSP)  for  25 

major  agricultural  commodities  each  year  in  both  the  Crop  seasons  after  taking  into  account 

the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).  

 CACP recommends MSP for twenty two (22) crops and Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) 

for  sugarcane.    Apart  from  Sugarcane  for  which  FRP  is  declared  by  the  Department  of  Food 

&Public  Distribution,  twenty  two  crops  covered  under  MSP  are  Paddy,  Jowar,  Bajra,  Maize, 

Ragi,  Arhar,  Moong,  Urad,  Groundnut-in-shell,  Soyabean,  Sunflower,  Seasamum,  Nigerseed, 

Cotton,  Wheat,  Barley,  Gram,  Masur  (lentil),  Rapeseed/Mustardseed,  Safflower,  Jute  and 

Copra. 

In  addition,  MSP  for  Toria  and  De-Husked  coconut  is  fixed  by  the  Department  on  the 

basis of MSP’s of Rapeseed/Mustardseed and Copra respectively. 

 

Besides,  announcement  of  MSP,  the  Government  also  organizes  procurement 

operations of these agricultural commodities through various public and cooperative agencies 

such as Food Corporation of India (FCI), Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), Jute Corporation of 

India  (JCI),  Central  Warehousing  Corporation  (CWC),  National  Agricultural  Cooperative 

Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED), National Consumer Cooperative Federation of India 

Ltd.  (NCCF),  and  Small  Farmers  Agro  Consortium  (SFAC).    Besides,  State  Governments  also 

appoint state agencies to undertake PSS operations.

While  deciding  the  MSP  for  various  agricultural  commodities,  the  recommendations  of 

CACP, the views of Central Ministries and State Governments and  such other relevant factors 

which  are  important  in  the  opinion  of  the  Government  are  considered.    The  CACP,  while 

recommending the Minimum Support Price keeps in view (i) the need to provide incentives to 

the  producers  for  adopting  improved  technology  and  for  developing  a  production  pattern 

broadly in the light of national requirements (ii) the need to  ensure rational utilization of land, 

water and other production resources and (iii) the likely effect of the price policy on the rest of 

the economy, particularly, on the cost of living, level of wages, industrial cost structure etc.   

NAFED,  Central  Warehousing  Corporation  (CWC)National  Consumer  Cooperative 

Federation  of  India  Ltd.  (NCCF),  Small  Farmers  Agro  Consortium  (SFAC)  are  the  central 

agenciesfor  procurement  of  oilseeds  &  pulses.  However,  NAFED  is  also  an  additional  central 

agency  for  procurement  of  cotton,  in  addition  to  Cotton  Corporation  of  India  (CCI)  under 

theDAC. 

 

 

 The cost of cultivation/production includes all paid out costs, such as, those incurred 

on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour (both hired and owned) and 

rent  paid  for  leased  in  land  besides  cash  and  kind  expenses  on  use  of  material  inputs  like 

seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges including cost of diesel/electricity for operation of 

pump sets, etc. Besides, cost of production includes imputed value of wages of family labour 

and rent for owned land. The cost also covers depreciation of farm machinery and buildings, 

transportation and insurance charges.  As such, the cost of production covers not only actual 

expenses in cash and kind but also imputed value of owned assets,  land and family labour. 

  NECESSITY FOR FRAMING OF PSS GUIDELINES: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Although the Price Support Scheme is in existence for more than 3 decades, there are 

no  guidelines  at  present  to  regulate  PSS  operation.  Experience  in  implementing  the  PSS  over 

the  years  has  shown  the  necessity  to  prepare  comprehensive  guidelines  for  effective 

implementation  of  the  scheme  to  ensure  that  the  farmers  are  benefited  and  to  put  in  place  a 

system  of  efficient  marketing,  development  of  non-traditional/new  markets,  processing  of 

agricultural produce for value addition and the sales through network of retail points.

increasing  holding  cost  and  quality  deterioration.Biological life is referred as Future Expiry 
Date  (FED)  in  the  parlance  of  commodity  exchange,  is  the  life  of  the  commodity  after

words, the disposal shall be carried out in most transparent and competitive manner well within 

the biological life of the procured stock and in the off season when the prices of the produced 

are usually high to secure highest price minimum loss to the Government. The Central agencies

the accounts and after accepting the same, either full or in part will send to the Department of 

Expenditure,through IFD, DACfor final acceptance of accounts.  The loss, if any, under the PSS 

will be reimbursed as per the notification by the Central Government. The computation of loss

DAC  shall  also  provide  1%  incentivesto  the  central  agencies  on  the  net  profit  earned  for 

disposal of PSS stocks. 

(xv)  Average yield district wise:While  undertaking  purchases  of  any  commodity  under  PSS, 

Central agencies may get the estimates of average yield and production in that area covered by 

the  procurement  centersfrom  concerned  State/UT  Government  authorities  to  ensure  the 

procurement of produce from the farmers only.  In case the variation in any particular area is 

beyond +/-20%, the specific reasons may also be recorded for higher procurement.

being offered under PSS has been harvested from his own/leased land. 

(xviii)Short recovery:  Central/state agencies should recover the value for any short recovery as 

per terms of the agreement entered into with the millers. Further, the common storage norms 

like  Moisture  Adjusted  Weight  (MAW)  for  the  procured  stock  must  be  accounted  for  by  the 

procurement agency.  

(xix)Booking commodity wise expenses:  Central  agencies  should  ensure  that  commodity  wise
