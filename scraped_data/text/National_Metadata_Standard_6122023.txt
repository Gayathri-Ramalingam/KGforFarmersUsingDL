Introduction 

 

 

 

National  Statistical  Office  (NSO),  Ministry  of  Statistics  &  Programme  Implementation, 

presents  and  disseminates  data  and  metadata  through  different  products  like  Census  data 

(Economic  Census);  Survey  data  such  as  NSS  Surveys  viz.  Household  Surveys,  etc,  Annual 

Survey of Industries  (ASI), Consumer Price  Indices  (CPI),  and macro-economic aggregates 

like  National  Income,  Index  of  Industrial  Production  (IIP).  In  addition,  statistical  data  is 

presented  in  analytical  publications  such  as  NSS  Reports,  Annual  Survey  of  Industries 

Reports,  National  Indicator  Framework  (NIF)  for  monitoring  SDGs,  Energy  Statistics, 

EnviStats  India,  Women  &  Men  in  India  etc.,  which  provide  analysis  of  data,  supported  by 

the visual presentation of that data in the form of graphs and maps. 

The  production  of  data  and  presentation  of  metadata  structure  requires  an  overview  of  the 

arrangements,  technical  infrastructure  and  skills  required  for  a  holistic  and  integrated 

approach  to  the  presentation  and  dissemination  of  statistical  data  and  metadata  to  different 

user  groups.  National  Metadata  Structure  (NMDS)  is  to  provide  guidelines  for  the  data 

producer to adhere to a basic minimum quality standard in order to establish and maintain the 

quality of data and enhance ease in sharing data. The specific objectives of this document are: 

 

to  promote  reporting  for  each  type  of  statistical  process  and  its  outputs  across 

different  Ministries/Divisions/Departments  of  NSO,  hence  facilitating  comparisons 

across processes and outputs; 

 

to  ensure  that  producer  reports  contain  all  the  information  required  to  facilitate 

identification of quality issues and potential improvements in statistical processes and 

their outputs; and 

 

to  ensure  that  user  reports  contain  all  the  information  required  by  users  to  assess 

whether statistical outputs are fit for the purposes they have in mind.

A. What is Metadata?  

A.1.  Metadata  should  contain  all  the  information  users  need  to  analyse  a  dataset  and  draw 

conclusions.  It  increases  data  accessibility  by  summarizing  the  most  important 

information  (i.e.  methodology,  sampling  design,  interview  mode,  etc.)  required  for 

analyzing  a  dataset  which  alleviates  the  need  for  users  to  search  for  supporting 

documents  and  reports.  Furthermore,  good  metadata  clearly  articulates  the  potential 

uses  for  a  dataset,  preventing  potential  misuses.  Metadata  is  also  a  tool  for  rendering 

complex microdata structures into something meaningful, navigable, and user-friendly. 

Finally,  the  adoption  of  well-known  metadata  schemas  and  vocabularies  allows  for 

semantic interoperability. 

The Metadata process  is fully integrated in  the  Generic Statistical  Business  Process  Model1 

(GSBPM) which has metadata as one of the key elements in the version 5.1.

B. Why Metadata? 

B.1.  In  most  information  technology  usages,  the  prefix  of  meta  conveys  “an  underlying 

definition  or  description.”  So  it  is  that,  at  its  most  basic,  metadata  is  data  about  data. 

More precisely, however, metadata describes data containing specific information like 

type,  length,  textual  description  and  other  characteristics.  Metadata  makes  it  much 

easier to find relevant data and to use a dataset, users need to understand how the data 

is structured, definitions of terms used, how it was collected, and how it should be read.  

B.2.  Metadata  is  an  important  way  to  protect  resources  and  their  future  accessibility.  For 

archiving and preservation purposes, it takes metadata elements that track the object’s 

lineage,  and  describe  its  physical  characteristics  and  behaviour  so  it  can  be  replicated 

on technologies in the future. 

 

 

 

B.3.  In today’s modern data driven world and in the era of digital transactions, huge amount 

of  data 

is  generated  on  real 

time  basis,  and 

lately,  a 

large  number  of 

organisations/agencies have started producing data, the quantum of which is huge, and 

thus  arises  a  need  of  standard  regulatory  framework  to  be  laid  down  to  assure  the 

quality  of  data  produced  by  different  producers.  It  will  also  serve  the  purpose  of 

ensuring  data  comparability  across  time  horizons  so  as  to  enable  better  understanding 

of different social and economic movements.

PIMD/Aug/2021/1 

 

 

 
B.4.  Although  metadata  may  not  seem  exciting  or  impressive,  the  true  importance  of 

metadata can never be underrated and hence, is important to take a concerted effort to 

build sound metadata structure to draw maximum gains from varied data sets.  

C. Role of MoSPI in Building Metadata Structure 

C.1.  MoSPI  being  a  nodal  agency  for  planned  development  of  the  statistical  system  in  the 

country is also responsible for maintaining the highest standards of data quality which 

adhere  to  basic  guidelines  of  International  Agencies  so  as  to  ensure  India’s  statistical 

system  is  one  of  the  frontrunners  in  quality  data  producer.  MoSPI  aims  at  raising  the 

National Statistical System (NSS) to the epitome of being one of the best professionally 

equipped government data producing agencies by building the best of IT infrastructure 

among others in the system, and Metadata is one of the building blocks to achieve the 

 

objective. 

C.2.  The document presents the NMDS in two formats- the first one is the indexed version 

as NMDS concepts (Section F), and the second one presents details of concepts through 

definition and guidelines (Section G). 

D. Metadata Management 

 

 

D.1  It  is  advisable  to  put  in  place  a  metadata  policy  by  the  official  statistical  producing 

agencies,  ab  initio.  The  policy  is  a  set  of  broad,  high  level  principles  that  form  the 

guiding framework within which metadata management can operate. 

D.2  Once  the  metadata  policy  is  put  in  place,  for  an  organisation,  metadata  should  be 

compiled  and  maintained  actively.  Otherwise,  the  currency,  and  thus  use  of  Metadata 

will degrade with time. To realise the full capabilities of Metadata, it is necessary that 

the  Metadata  are  maintained  over  a  long  period  of  time.  Even  with  investment  in 

technically  sophisticated  search  tools,  such  systems  may  find  little  stakeholders 

acceptance, if the data are incomplete or is not updated regularly.

While preparing the NMDS, the following core principles should be borne in mind: 

i.  Metadata Handling: 

a.  Statistical Business Process Model 
b.  Active, not Passive 
c.  Reuse for Efficiency 
d.  Version Preservations 
 

ii.  Metadata Authority 
e.  Registration 
f.  Single Source 
g.  One Entry/Update 
h.  Standards Variations 
 

Integrity 

i. 
j.  Matching Metadata 
k.  Describe Flow 
l.  Capture at Source 
m.  Exchange and Use 
 

n.  Identify Users 
o.  Variant Formats 
p.  Availability 

iv.  Users 

iii.  Relationship to Statistical Business Processes 

E. Retention, Preservation, and Destruction 

National  Statistics  constitute  valuable  and  irreplaceable  assets  whose  value  can  increase 

through widespread and long-term use. National Statistics should thus be backed by the Data 

Management  Policy  eliciting  the  arrangements  it  has  in  place  for  the  retention,  long  term 

preservation, and destruction of its resources including Metadata.

Accuracy 
Reliability 

and 

Accuracy  of  data  is  the  closeness  of  computations  or  estimates  to  the  exact  or  true  values  that  the 
statistics  were  intended  to  measure.  Reliability  of  the  data,  defined  as  the  closeness  of  the  initial 
estimated value to the subsequent estimated value. 

5.1 

Sampling error 

the  difference 
That  part  of 
between  a  population  value  and 
an  estimate 
thereof,  derived 
from a random sample, which is 
due to the fact that only a subset 
of the population is enumerated. 

If probability sampling is used: 
 for user reports-provide the range of variation of the A13 indicator among 
key variables at user report level of detail;  
  for  producer  reports-provide  the  range  of  variation  of  the  A1  indicator 
among key variables at producer report level of detail; 
  indicate  the  impact  of  sampling  error  on  the  overall  accuracy  of  the 
results; 
 state how the calculation of sampling error is affected by adjustments for 
nonresponse,  misclassifications  and  other  sources  of  uncertainty,  such  as 
outlier treatment. 
 
If non-probability sampling is used: 
provide  an  assessment  of  representativeness,  a  motivation  for  the  invoked 
model for estimation and risk of sampling bias 
 

                                                           
3  In  international  terminology,  A1  is  simply  used  for  Sampling  Errors.  In  other  words,  indicator  for  Sampling  Errors  is  denoted  by  A1.  For  further  details,  refer  to:
