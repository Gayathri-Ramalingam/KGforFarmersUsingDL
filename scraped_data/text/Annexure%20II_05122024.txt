Standard  Classification 

NCO  is  a  classification  of  occupations  which 
describes  and  assigns  codes  to  the  various 
occupations in the country and aligns it with the 
International 
of 
Occupations (ISCO). These codes are reviewed 
and 
reflect 
developments in the labour market, particularly 
with the emergence of new occupations, as well 
as  to  align  with  changes  in  the  international 
standards. These codes also help in promoting 
international  comparability  of  statistical  data 
relating  to  occupations.  These  occupational 
standards  follow  a  scientific  and  hierarchical 
approach having major, minor and unit groups 
of  classification  which  has  evolved  over  the 
years  to  capture  the  structural  changes  in  the

The Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) were 
developed to improve the quality of services and 
provide  a  uniform  benchmark  to  assess  the 
functionality  of  public  health  facilities.  These 
standards  cover  Sub  Health  Centres  (SHCs), 
Primary  Health  Centres  (PHCs),  Community 
Health Centres (CHCs), Sub District Hospitals 
(SDHs)  and  District  Hospitals  (DHs).  They 
provide  guidance  on  the  infrastructure,  human 
resource, drugs, diagnostics, equipment, quality 
and  governance  requirements  for  delivering 
health services at these facilities.
