transformation) of any types 
of goods together with performing services incidental to sales such as 
repair, installation and

PRICE SUPPORT SCHEME (PSS): THE OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES  
 
CHAPTER – I 
 
 
 INTRODUCTION  
  A ssurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for gro wers/farmers is very 
important for increasing agricultural production and productivity. The market price for 
agricultural produce many times tends to be unstable and volati le which may result into undue 
losses to the growers and discou rage adoption of the modern technology and required inputs.  
  
  The Government’s price policy for agricultural commodities se eks to ensure 
r e m u n e r a t i v e  p r i c e s  t o  t h e  g r o w e r s  f o r  t h e i r  p r o d u c e  w i t h  a  v i e w to encourage higher 
investment and production and to safeguard the interest of cons umers by making available 
supplies at reasonable prices with low cost of intermediation.  The price policy also seeks to 
evolve a balanced and integrated price structure in the perspec tive of the overall needs of the 
economy.  
 
  Towards this end, the Government announces, Minimum Support P rices (MSP) for 25 
major agricultural commodities each year in both the Crop seasons after taking into account 
the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).  
 
   CACP recommends MSP for twenty two (22) crops and Fair & Remune rative Price (FRP) 
for sugarcane.  Apart from Sugarcane for which FRP is declared by the Department of Food 
&Public Distribution, twenty two crops covered under MSP are Pa ddy, Jowar, Bajra, Maize, 
Ragi, Arhar, Moong, Urad, Groundnut-in-shell, Soyabean, Sunflow er, Seasamum, Nigerseed, 
Cotton, Wheat, Barley, Gram, Masur (lentil), Rapeseed/Mustardse ed, Safflower, Jute and 
Copra. 
 
  In addition, MSP for Toria and De-Husked coconut is fixed by the Department on the 
basis of MSP’s of Rapeseed/Mustardseed and Copra respectively.   
 
  Besides, announcement of MSP, the Government also organizes p rocurement 
operations of these agricultural  commodities through various public and cooperative agencies 
such as Food Corporation of India (FCI), Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), Jute Corporation of 
India (JCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), National Ag ricultural Cooperative 
Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED), National Consumer C ooperative Federation of India 
Ltd. (NCCF), and Small Farmers Agro Consortium (SFAC).  Besides , State Governments also 
appoint state agencies to undertake PSS operations.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
-2-  
 
  While deciding the MSP for various agricultural commodities, the recommendations of 
CACP, the views of Central Ministries and State Governments and  such other relevant factors 
which are important in the opinion of the Government are consid e r e d .   T h e  C A C P ,  w h i l e  
recommending the Minimum Support Price keeps in view (i) the ne ed to provide incentives to 
the producers for adopting improved technology and for developi ng a production pattern 
broadly in the light of national requirements (ii) the need to ensure rational utilization of land, 
water and other production resources and (iii) the likely effec t of the price policy on the rest of 
the economy, particularly, on the  cost of living, level of wage s, industrial cost structure etc.   
  
  NAFED, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC)National Consumer C ooperative 
Federation of India Ltd. (NCCF), Small Farmers Agro Consortium ( S F A C )  a r e  t h e  c e n t r a l  
agenciesfor procurement of oilseeds & pulses. However, NAFED is  also an additional central 
agency for procurement of cotton, in addition to Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) under theDAC.  
   The cost of cultivation/product ion includes all paid out costs , such as, those incurred 
on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour  (both hired and owned) and 
rent paid for leased in land besides cash and kind expenses on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges including cost of diesel/electricity for operation of 
pump sets, etc. Besides, cost of production includes imputed va lue of wages of family labour 
and rent for owned land. The cost also covers depreciation of f arm machinery and buildings, 
transportation and insurance charges.  As such, the cost of pro duction covers not only actual 
expenses in cash and kind but also imputed value of owned asset s,  land and family labour.  
 
 NECESSITY FOR FRAMING OF PSS GUIDELINES:  
 
  Although the Price Support Scheme is in existence for more th an 3 decades, there are 
no guidelines at present to regulate PSS operation. Experience in implementing the PSS over 
the years has shown the necessity to prepare comprehensive guid elines for effective 
implementation of the scheme to ensure that the farmers are ben efited and to put in place a 
system of efficient marketing, development of non-traditional/n ew markets, processing of 
agricultural produce for value addition and the sales through n etwork of retail points.

CHAPTER-II  
 
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERN MENT/AGENCIES IN PSS OPERATION S 
 
(A)  Department of Agriculture & Cooperation (DAC):  
(i) Policy matters : The DAC shall be responsible for any policy matters relating to PSS 
operations for oilseed, pulses, cotton, any other commodities which may be assigned and/or 
any other matter for which the opinion is sought from time to time.  
(ii) Nomination /deletion of central agencies : The DAC shall be responsible for nomination of 
other central agencies and/ or deletion of any agency from the list of central agency. 
(ii) Declaration of bonus, if any : While announcing MSP, the DAC may also announce bonus 
on various crops, if any, from time to time.  (iii) 
Declaration of Minimum  Support Price (MSP):  
The Department of Agriculture & Cooperation shall declare the  Minimum Support Price for 
notified agricultural commodities every year, well before both the cropping/sowing season so 
that the farmers may take a considered view whether the said pa rticular crop will be a profitable 
venture for them or not. Further, the DAC shall have the right to decide the duration of 
procurement period, state wise, for the crops for which MSP is declared and procured by its 
central agencies 
(iv) MSP information : All the central nodal agencies shall be informed by DAC about  the MSP 
for notified crops in every cr op season, well in advance.  
(v) Duration of the Scheme : T h e  D A C  s h a l l  b e  r e s p o n s i b l e  t o  d e c i d e  t h e  d u r a t i o n  o f  t h e  
scheme, crop-wise, state-wise, depending upon the seasonality/c limatic/geographical/ 
locational advantages and disadvantages. The duration of PSS op erations for a particular crop 
and seasonshall be for a maximum period of 90 days. However, in  exceptional cases, this may 
be increased with the prior approval of DAC. 
(vi)  Fair Average Quality (FAQ) norms : Fair Average Quality (FAQ) norms shall be decided/ 
approved by the DAC for each crop. While, deciding the FAQ norm s, it shall be ensured that 
only those parameters which are variable would form the specifi cation of FAQ norms. However, 
deviation from FAQ norms may be allowed only in exceptional cas es and with the prior approval 
of DAC only. Further, in order to be sure that the proposed sto ck is of FAQ norms or not, the 
procurement agency may appoint a third party quality certificat ion agency on its own cost.   
(vii) Working capital arrangement : The DAC shall provide working capital to its central 
agenciesthrough Government guarantee, letter of comforts etc., after the stock is hypothecated 
in the name of central agencies. (viii)  
Vetting of accounts and settlement of claims of central agencie s: The DAC shall examine

Government/Central Procurement Agency. It shall be ensured that  the stock is stored safely and 
scientifically so that it does not suffer any preventive loss.  
(x)  Limitation on holding the stock :The procured material shall be stored only to its 
biological life but not exceeding six months from the closure o f PSS operation to avoid 
increasing holding cost and quality deterioration. Biological life is referred as Future Expiry 
Date (FED) in the parlance of commodity ex change, is the life of the commodity after 
which it must be re-assessed/ consumed in or der to remain fit for human consumption.  
Further, while holding the stock, the seasonality/durability of  that particular crop shall also be 
kept in mind. However, in exceptional circumstances, requiring stocking over 6 months, prior 
approval of the DAC should be ob tained.  It will be the respons ibility of the warehouse company

mechanism should be discouraged for better realization and grea ter transparency. In other 
words, the disposal shall be carried out in most transparent an d competitive manner well within 
the biological life of the procured stock and in the off season  when the prices of the produced 
are usually high to secure highest price minimum loss to the Go vernment. The Central agencies 
may also seek other supports like marketing, transporting, godo wn/warehouse from other 
private players available in the market.  The procured stock ma y be disposed within the State or 
outside. The central/state agenci es shall maintain a verifiable  data of prices throughout the year

Data Dissemination: National  Metadata Structure ( NMDS) For 
Statistical Products

National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation, 
presents and disseminates data and metadata through different products like Cen sus data 
(Economic Census); Survey data such as NSS Surveys viz. Household Surveys, etc, Annual 
Survey of Industries (ASI) , Consumer Price Indices (CPI), and macro -economic aggregates 
like National Income , Index  of Industrial Production (IIP) . In addition,  statistical data is 
presented in analytical publications such as NSS Reports, Annual Survey of Industries 
Reports, National Indicator Framework (NIF) for monitoring SDGs, Energy Statistics, 
EnviStats India, Women & Men in India etc., which provide analysi s of data, supported by 
the visual presentation of that data in the form of graphs and maps . 
The production of data and presentation of metadata structure requires  an overview of the 
arrangements, technical infrastructure and skills required for a holistic  and integrated 
approach to the presentation and dissemination of statistical data and metadata to different 
user groups. National  Metadata Structure ( NMDS) is to provide guidelines for the data 
producer to adhere to a basic minimum quality standard in ord er to establish and maintain the 
quality of data and enhance ease in sharing data. The specific objectives of this document are : 
 to promote reporting for each type of statistical process and its outputs across 
different Ministries/ Divisions /Departments  of NSO, hence facilitating comparisons 
across processes and outputs;  
 to ensure that producer reports contain all the information required to facilitate 
identification of quality issues  and potential improvements in statistical processes and 
their outputs; and  
 to ensure that user reports contain all the information required by users to assess 
whether statistical outputs are fit for the purposes they have in mind.  Introduction  
PIMD/ Aug/2021/1

A.1. Metadata should contain all the information users need to analyse  a dataset and  draw 
conclusions.  It increases data accessibility by summarizing the most important 
information (i.e. methodology, sampling design, interview mode, etc.) required for 
analyzing a dataset which alleviates the need for users to search for supporting 
documents and reports. Fu rthermore, good metadata clearly articulates the potential 
uses for a dataset, preventing potential misuses. Metadata is also a tool for rendering 
complex microdata structures into something meaningful, navigable, and user -friendly. 
Finally, the adoption o f well -known metadata schemas and vocabularies allows for 
semantic interoperability.  
 
The Metadata process is fully integrated in the Generic Statistical Business Process Model1 
(GSBPM) which has metadata as one of the key elements in the version 5.1.

https://statswiki.unece.org/display/GSBPM/GSBPM+v5.1  A. What is Metadata?  
PIMD/ Aug/2021/1  
  
 
4 | P a g e  
   
B.1. In most information technology usag es, the prefix of meta conveys “ an underl ying 
definition or description.”  So it is that, at its most basic , metadata is data about data . 
More precisely, ho wever, metadata describes data containing specific information like 
type, length, textual description and other characteristics . Metadata makes it much 
easier to find relevant data and to use a dataset, users need to understand how the data 
is structured, definitions of terms used, how it was collected, and how it should be read.  
B.2. Metadata is an important way to protect resources  and their future accessibility . For 
archiving and preservation purposes, it takes metadata elements that track the object’s 
linea ge, and describe its physical characteristics and behaviour  so it can be replicated 
on technologies in the future.  
 
 
B.3. In today’s modern data driven world and in the era of digital transactions, huge amount 
of data is generated on  real time basis, and lately, a large number of 
organisations/agencies have started producing data, the quantum of which is huge, and 
thus arises a need of standard regulatory framework to be laid down to assure the 
quality of data produced by different pr oducers. It will also serve the purpose of 
ensuring data comparability  across time horizons so as to enable better understanding 
of different social and economic movements.  
B. Why Metadata?  
PIMD/ Aug/2021/1  
  
 
5 | P a g e  
 B.4. Although metadata may not seem  exciting or impressive, the true importance of 
metad ata can never be underrated  and hence, is important to take a concerted effort to 
build sound metadata structure  to draw maximum gains from varied data sets .  
 
C.1. MoSPI being a nodal agency for planned development of the statistical system in the 
country  is also responsible for maintaining the highest standards of data quality which 
adhere to basic guidelines of International Agencies so as to ensure India’s statistical 
system is one of the frontrunners in quality data producer.  MoSPI aims at raising the 
National Statistical System (NSS) to the epitome of being one of the best professionally 
equipped government data producing agencies by building the best of IT infrastructure 
among others in the system, and Metadata is one of the building blocks to achieve th e 
objective . 
C.2. The document presents the NMDS  in two formats - the first one is the indexed version 
as NMDS concepts  (Section F ), and the second one present s details of concepts through 
definition and guidelines  (Section G ). 
 
D.1 It is advisable to put in place a metadata pol icy by the official statistical producing 
agencies, ab initio. The policy is a set of broad, high level principles that form the 
guiding framework within which metadata management can operate.  
D.2 Once the metadata policy is put in place, for an organisati on, metadata should be 
compiled and maintained actively. Otherwise, the currency , and thus use of Metadata 
will degrade with time. To realise the full capabilities of Metadata, it is necessary that 
the Metadata are maintained over a long period of time . Even with investment in 
technically sophisticated search tools, such systems may find little stakeholders 
acceptance, if the data are incomplete or is not updated regularly.  C. Role of MoSPI i n Building Metadata Structure

 While preparing the NMDS, the following core principles should be borne in min d: 
i. Metadata Handling:  
a. Statistical Business Process Model  
b. Active, not Passive  
c. Reuse for Efficiency  
d. Version Preservations  
 
ii. Metadata Authority  
e. Registration  
f. Single Source  
g. One Entry/Update  
h. Standards Variations  
 
iii. Relationship to Statistical Business Processes  
i. Integrity  
j. Matching Metadata  
k. Describe Flow  
l. Capture at Source  
m. Exchange and Use  
 
iv. Users  
n. Identify Users  
o. Variant Formats  
p. Availability  
 
National Statistics constitute valuable and irreplaceable assets whose value can increase 
through widespread and long-term use. N ational Statistics should thus be backed by the Data 
Management Policy eliciting the arrangements it has in place for the retention, long term 
preservation, and destruction of its resources including Metadata.

Reliability  Accuracy of data is the closeness of computations or estimates to the exact or true values that the 
statistics were intended to measur e. Reliability of the data, defined as the closeness of the initial 
estimated value to the subsequent estimated value.  
5.1 Sampling error  That part of the difference 
between a population value and 
an estimate thereof, derived 
from a random sample, which i s 
due to the fact that only a subset 
of the population is enumerated.  If probability sampling is used:  
 for user reports -provide the range of variation of the A13 indicator among 
key variables at user report level of detail;  
 for producer reports -provide  the range of variation of the A1 indicator 
among key variables at producer report level of detail;  
 indicate the impact of sampling error on the overall accuracy of the 
results;  
 state how the calculation of sampling error is affected by adjustments for  
nonresponse, misclassifications and other sources of uncertainty, such as 
outlier treatment.  
 
If non -probability sampling is used:  
provide an assessment of representativeness, a motivation for the invoked 
model for estimation and risk of sampling bias

Comparability  Adequacy of statistics to be reliably combined in different ways and for various uses and the extent to 
which differences between statistics can be attributed to differences between the true values of the 
statistical characteristics  
7.1 Comparability – 
over time  The extent to which statistics are 
comparable or reconcilable over 
time Provide information on possible limitations in the use of data for 
comparisons over time. Distinguish three broad possibilities:  
1. There have been no changes, in which case this should be reported.  
2. There have been some changes but not enough to warrant the designation 
of a break in series.  
3. There have been sufficient changes to warrant the designatio n of a break 
in series . 
7.2 Coherence  The extent to which statistics are 
reconcilable with System of 
National Accounts   For producer reports only. Where relevant, the results of comparisons with 
the System of National Accoun t framework / Other Statistical Standards 
and feedback from System of National Accounts / Other Statistical 
Standards with respect to coherence and accuracy problems should be 
reported and should be a trigger for further investigation.

1.1 पररभािा 
 
थोक मूल्य को आम तौर पर घरेलू बाजार में ककए गए वस् तुओं क े  सभी बडे लेनदेन संबंधी जानकारी प्राप् त  करने क े  कलए 
पररभाकित ककया जाता है।  
 
1.2 थसक मूल्सों का ‍ोंग्रिण  
 
मूल्य कोटेशन  प्राप्त करते समय , कनम्नकलखित मुद्ों को ध्यान में रिा जाता है।  
 
(क) मूल्य कोटेशन  वास्तव में बाजार का दौरा करक े  और प्रमुि लेनदेन का  कनरीक्षण करक े , साथ ही बाजार में कई 
व् यापाररयों से मौखिक पूछताछ क े  द्वारा प्राप्त की जाती  है। 
 
(ि) मूल् य, बाजार में क े वल एक कवकशष् ट  दुकान से एकत्र नहीं ककया जाता है बखि पूरे बाजार की प्रवृख‍ त पर 
आधाररत हो ता है। 
 
(ग) कोटेशन मॉडल कीमत है , अथाात्  वह कीमत कजस पर ररपोकटिंग क े  कदन कवपणन  की चरम अवकध क े  दौरान 
अकधकांश लेनदेन हुए हैं। जब लेन -देन की संख्या कम होती है और कोई मोडल मूल्य नहीं होता है , तो वह मूल्य कजस 
पर एक लॉट में अकधकतम मात्रा बेची जाती है, को ररपोटा  ककया जाता है।  
 
(घ) जब कवकनयकमत बाजार मौजूद होता है, तो बाजार सकमकत क े  मूल्य ररकॉडा का उपयोग मूल्य कोटेशन  एकत्र 
करने में ककया जाता है।  
 
(ङ) मूल्य एकत्र करने क े  कलए कनयुक्त व्यखक्त को मूल्य संग्रह काया में उकचत रूप से प्रकशकक्षत ककया जाता है और 
इसक े  कलए उस बाजार में कनयकमत रूप से दौरा करता है और साप्ताकहक आधार पर कीमतों की ररपोटा करता है।  
 
(च) यकद ककसी वस्तु की कीमत में कबक्री या िरीद कर या उ त्पाद शुि शाकमल है , तो ररपोटा ककए गए मूल्य 
कोटेशन  में शाकमल कर या उत्पाद शुि को कचख‍ ह त ककया जाता  है। 
 
(छ) यकद कई सप् ताह क े  कलए खिर कीमतों की ररपोटा दी जाती है, तो हमेशा उसक े  कारण कदए जाते हैं। इसी 
प्रकार, यकद ककसी कज‍ स में लगातार क ु छ समय तक कोई लेन -देन प्रभाकवत नहीं होता है , तो उसक े  कारण भी 
बताए जाते हैं। 
 
(ज) कपछले सप्ताह की तुलना में ररपोटा  ककए गए सप्ताह क े  कलए ककसी कज‍ स  की कीमत में 10% या इससे अकधक 
की वृखि या कमी क े  कारणों को संबंकधत एमआई यूकनट  द्वारा संककलत साप्ताकहक ररपोटा में भी दशााया  जाता है। 
 
(झ) थोक मूल्य रुपये प्रकत कव ं टल क े  संदभा में उद ् धृत ककया जाता है। तथाकप, पटसन  गांठों क े  मामले में, उपयुक्त 
मानक इकाई 18 कक. ग्रा. की गांठ ें है। नाररयल और अंडों का थोक मूल्य रूपए प्रकत हजार (1000), क े ले, भेड 
की िाल और बकरी की िाल प्रकत सौ (100), चाय प्रकत ककलो , कॉफी प्रकत 50 कक. ग्रा., सुपरफॉस्फ े ट प्रकत 
मीकट ि क टन और फ ू लगोभी प्रकत दजान  क े  अनुसार  उद ् धृत ककया जाता है। उन बाजारों में जहां िानीय बाट और माप 
प्रचलन में हैं, प्राथकमक ररपोटार िानीय  बाट या माप क े  रूप में मूल्य एकत्र करते हैं और इसे अखिल भारतीय मानक 
इकाई में पररवकतात करते हैं। अखिल भारतीय मानक इकाई , कजससे उद ् धृत मूल्य संबंकधत है , कनधााररत प्रपत्र 
(पररकशष्ट I) क े  संबंकधत कॉलम में प्रत्येक कज‍ स क े  सामने दशााया जाता है। 
 
  
[viii] 
 2. प्राथषम क और षितीयक  मूल् 
2.1 पररभािा 
 
प्राथकमक बाजार क े  कलए प्राथकमक थोक मूल्य और कद्वतीयक बाजार क े  कलए कद्वतीयक थोक मूल्य साप्ताकहक मूल्य ररटना 
में उद ् धृत ककए जाते हैं। एक बाजार को ककसी कज‍ स क े  कलए प्राथकमक बाजार क े  रूप में  तब नाकमत ककया जाता है यकद 
सामग्री  का बडा कहस्सा गांवों या गांव क े  हा टों से आता है। द ू सरी ओर ,कद्वतीयक बाजार एक ऐसा बा जार है जहां 
अकधकांश सामग्री  अन्य बाजारों से आती है। मूल्य की प्रक ृ कत अथाात प्राथकमक या कद्वतीयक को कनधााररत प्रोफामाा 
(पररकशष्ट I) क े  कॉलम (5) में कोटेशन  क े  अनुसार प्राथकमक मूल्य क े  कलए प्रतीक (पी) और कद्वतीयक मूल्य क े  
कलए (एस) द्वारा इंकगत ककया  जाता है। 
 
2.2 प्राथकमक बाजार क े  मामले में , कभी-कभी यह पाया जाता है कक उत्पादक या गााँव क े  व्यापारी या इकटनेरंट 
ट िेडर और थोक व्यापारी क े  बीच लेन -देन आम तौर पर नीलामी क े  माध्यम से या ककसी अ‍ य प्रकार से सुबह में होता है 
अथवा  दोपहर में  लेन-देन स्वयं थोक कवक्र े ताओं क े  बीच या थोक कवक्र े ताओं तथा िुदरा कवक्र े ता  क े  बीच होता है। ऐसे 
मामलों में, ररपोटा की जाने वाली कीमतें वे हैं जो क े वल सुबह क े  लेन -देन क े  दौरान होती हैं , अथाात प्राथकमक बाजार  
में; दोपहर की कीमतें कजस पर थोक कवक्र े ताओं या थोक कवक्र े ताओं और िुदरा कवक्र े ताओं क े  बीच लेन -देन होता है, 
की सूचना नहीं दी जाती है। उन प्राथकमक बाजारों में जहां िुली नीलामी की प्रणाली प्रचकलत नहीं है , उत्पादक अपने 
उत्पादों को दलालों क े  माध्यम से बेचते हैं , मॉडल मूल्य कजस पर उत्पादक या गााँव क े  व्यापारी या इकटनेरंट ट िेडर 
अपनी उपज बेचते हैं , को ररपोटा ककया जा ता है न कक थोक कवक्र े ताओं  द्वारा उद ् धृत मूल्य को जो आम तौर पर बेचने 
की कीमत होती  है न कक वास्तव में िरीदी  गई कीमत । 
 
2.3 जब एक विा क े  लीन समय क े  दौरान प्राथकमक बाजार में उत्पादक या गााँव क े  व्यापारी या इकटनेरंट ट िेडर और 
थोक कवक्र े ताओं क े  बीच कोई लेन -देन नहीं होता है , तो कद्वतीयक मूल्य , यानी कजस मूल् य पर थोक व्यापाररयां  आपस 
में लेन-देन करते हैं, को ररपोटा ककया जाता  है। प्रसंस्क ृ त कज‍ सों  जैसे चावल (कमल्ड), कपास कलंट, तेल आकद क े  
मामले में, कजस कीमत पर कमलर और थोक व्यापारी क े  बीच लेन -देन होता है, उसे कद्वतीयक मूल्य माना जाता है। 
हालांकक, उन क्षेत्रों में, जहां ककसान क े  कलए एक कमल या कजन क े  माध्यम से वस्तु को संसाकधत करने और संसाकधत 
वस्तु को थोक व्यापारी को बेचने की सामान्य प्रथा है , कजस कीमत पर ऐसा लेनदेन उत्पादक या ग्राम व्यापारी या 
इकटनेरंट ट िेडर और थोक व्यापारी क े  बीच होता है को प्राथकमक मूल्य क े  रूप में माना जाता है।  
 
3. षकस्म का चयन  
 
3.1 षकस्म और गुणवत्ता का चयन  
 
कज‍ सो  की ककस्म  और गुणवत्ता कजससे मूल्य कोटेशन  संबंकधत है, प्रत्येक वस्तु क े  कलए कनकदाष्ट की जाती है। जहां त क 
संभव है, ररपोटा की गई कीमत पूरे विा में एक ही ककस्म और गुणवत्ता से संबंकधत होती है। 
 
यकद आमतौर पर क े वल एक ही ककस्म का लेन -देन ककया जाता है और कजसकी  आवक कनरंतर आधार  पर पूरे विा 
उपलब् ध  होती है, तो इस ककस्म की  कज‍ स का चयन ककया  जाता है। यकद यह संभव नहीं है , तो दो या तीन अकतररक्त 
ककस्में जो सबसे आम हैं और जो मूल ककस्म क े  पयााप्त रूप से करीब हैं , का चयन पहले से ककया जाता हैं और यकद 
मूल ककस्म बाजार में आना बंद हो जाती है  तो उनमें से एक को उद ् धृत ककया जाता है । हालााँकक, जैसे ही मूल रूप से 
तय की गई ककस्म कफर से उपलब्ध होती है , ररपोटा की गई कीमत , उस ककस्म से संबंकधत होती है। जब भी ककस्म में 
कोई बदलाव होता है तो पुरानी और नई दो नों ककस्मों की कीमतों को एक या दो सप्ताह क े  ररटना में कदया जाता है ताकक 
तुलना की जा सक े ।  
 
उद ् धृत मूल्य चयकनत ककस्म की उकचत औसत गुणवत्ता से संबंकधत है। िाद्यान्न और चीनी की कीमतें भारतीय िाद्य 
कनगम द्वारा कनधााररत और समय -समय पर कनदेशालय द्वारा पररचाकलत उकचत औसत गुणवत्ता क े  कवकनदेशों क े  आलोक

गया है। ककस्म को कनकदाष्ट करने में , इसका नाम कदया जाता है , उदा. चावल क े  मामले में , ककस्म को बारीक , 
मध्यम और मोटे या पहली ककस्म या द ू सरी ककस्म क े  रूप में कन कदाष्ट करना पयााप्त नहीं हो ता। ककस्म का वास्तकवक नाम 
(अथाात, सेला, साली, अक्क ु लु, सांबा, बासमती, आकद) कदया जाता है और ककस्म क े  नाम क े  साथ इसकी  
बारीकी, मध्यम, मोटा या पहली ककस्म या द ू स री ककस्म का वगीकरण भी कदया जाता है। चावल क े  मामले में , यह 
भी उल्लेि ककया जाता है कक यह कपसा हुआ है (एम) या हाथ से पाउंड (एचपी) और उबला हुआ (बी) या अरवा

 COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF WEEKLY  WHOLESALE PRICES OF 
AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES  
 
1. WHOLESALE PRICES  
 
1.1 DEFINITION  
 
Wholesale price is generally defined to capture all bulk transactions of goods carried out in the 
domestic market.  
 
1.2 COLLECTION OF THE WHOL ESALE PRICES  
 
While obtaining the price quotations, the following issues are taken into consideration.  
 
(a) The price quotation is obtained by actually visiting the market and observing the major 
transactions, supplemented by oral enquiries from a number of dealers in the market.  
 
(b) The price is not collected from only one particular shop in the market but is based on a sense of 
the whole market.  
 
(c) The quotation is the modal p rice, i.e. the price at which mo st of the transactions have taken place 
during the peak period of marketing on the day of reporting. When number of transactions is few and 
there is no modal price, the price at which the maximum quantity is sold in one lot is reported.  
 
(d) Whenever regulated markets exist, the price records of th e market committee are utilized in 
collecting the price quotation s.  
 
(e) The person deputed for collecting prices is properly trained in the price collection work  and 
makes regular visits to the deputed market for the same  and report the prices on weekly basis . 
 
(f) In case, the price of a commodity is inclusive of sales or purchase tax or excise duty, the rate of 
tax or excise duty included in the price quotation reported is indicated . 
 
(g) If constant prices are reported for weeks together, reasons for t he same are invariably given. 
Similarly, if no transactions are affected in a commodity continuously for some time, reasons for the 
same are also stated.  
 
(h) The reasons for increase or decrease of 10% and more in the price of a commodity for the week 
under report over that for the previous week are also highlighted in the weekly report compiled  by 
the respective MI units.  
 
(i) The wholesale price is quoted in terms of rupees per quintal. In the case of bailed Jute, however, 
the appropriate standard unit is a bail of 18 kg. The wholesale price of coconuts and eggs is quoted in 
terms of rupees per thousand (1000) , of Bananas, Sheep Skin and Goat Skin per hundred (100) , of 
Tea per kg; of coffee per 50  kg, of superphosphate per metric ton  and of cauliflower pe r dozen. In 
the markets where local weights and measures are in vogue, the primary reporters collect the price in 
terms of local weights or measures and convert it into All –India Standard Unit. The All India 
Standard Unit to which the price quoted relates is indicated against each commodity in the respective 
column of the prescribed proforma (Appendix I).  
 
[viii] 
 2. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PRICES  
 
2.1  DEFINITION  
 
Primary wholesale prices for a primary market and secondary wholesale prices for a secondary 
market are quoted in the weekly prices returns. A market is designated as a primary market for a 
commodity if the bulk of the arrivals are from villages or village  haats. On the other hand, a 
secondary market is a market where bulk of the arrivals is from other ma rkets. The nature of price 
viz., primary or secondary is indicated by symbol (p) for primary price and (s) for secondary price 
against the quotation in column (5) of the prescribed proforma (Appendix I)  
 
2.2 In the case of a primary mar ket, some times it is found that transactions between producer or 
village merchant or itinerant trader and wholesalers generally take place in the morning through 
auction or otherwise and in the afternoon transactions also take place between wholesalers 
themselves or between w holesalers and retailers. In such cases , prices  to be reported are those  which 
prevail during the morning transactions only, i.e., in the primary market; afternoon prices at which 
transactions might take place between wholesalers or wholesalers and retaile rs are not  reported.  In 
those primary markets where the system of open auction does not prevail but producers sell their 
products through brokers, modal price at which the producer  or village merchant or itinerant trader 
sell their produce is reported and not the prices quoted by the wholesalers which are generally  the 
prices at which they are prepared to sell rather than the prices at which they have actually purchased.   
 
2.3 When there are no transactions between producer or village merchant or itinerant trader and 
wholesalers i n a primary market during the le an part o f a year, secondary price, i.e. , the price at 
which wholesalers transact among themselves, is reported. In the case of processed commodities 
such as rice (milled), cotton lint, oil , etc. the price at which the transaction takes place between the 
miller and the wholesalers is treated as secondary price. However, in those regions, where the 
general practice is for the cultivator to get the commodity processed through a mill or a gin and th en 
to sell the processed commodity to the wholesaler, the price at which such transaction take s place 
between the producer or village merchant or itinerant trader and the wholesaler is treated as a 
primary price.  
 
 
 
3. SELECTION OF VARIETY   
 
3.1 SELECTION OF V ARIETY AND QUALITY  
 
The variety and quality of the commodity to which the price quotation relates , is specified for each 
commodity. As far as practicable, the price reported is relate d to the same variety and quality 
though -out the year.  
 
If only a single variety is commonly transacted and its arrivals are continuous throughout  the year, 
this variety is selected for the commodity. If this is not poss ible, two or three additional varieties  
which are most common and which are sufficiently close to the origina l variety are fixed up in 
advance and one of them is quoted if the original variety ceases to arrive in the market. However, as 
soon as the variety, originally fixed is again available, price reported is relate d to that variety. 
Whenever  there is a change in the variety , the prices of both the old and the new varieties are given 
in the returns for one or two weeks so as to enable comparison.  
 
The price quoted is relate d to the fair average quality of the select ed variety. The prices for food  
grains and sug ar are collected in the light of specifications for FAQ laid down by the Food 
Corporation of India and circulated by the Directorate from time to time.  
[ix] 
  
3.2 INDICATION OF VARIETY AND QUALITY IN PRICE RETURNS  
 
The variety and quality is indicated against e ach commodity in column (2) of the prescribed 
proforma given in (Appendix I). In specifying the variety, its name is indicated, e. g. in case of rice,  
it will not be enough to specify the variety as fine, medium and coarse or first sort or second sort. 
The actual name of the variety (i. e., Sela, Sali, Akkulu, Samba, Basmati, etc.) is given and its 
classification into fine, medium, coarse or first sort or second sort is also  given along with the name 
of the variety. In case of rice , it is also  mentioned whe ther it is milled (M) or hand pounded (HP) and 
whether it is boiled (B) or arwa (A). Generally, the Fair Average Quality (FAQ) is selected and this 
is mentioned in column (2) of the prescribed proforma . 
 
 
4.  MISCELLANEOUS  
 
4.1 REPORTING OF PRICE INCLUSIVE  OF EXICE DUTY  
 
The price quotations of vegetables oils, tobacco, sugar, khandsari, tea a nd coffee reported in the price  
returns  are inclusive of excise duty. The rates of excise duty for the quotation reported are indicated 
in the return.   
 
4.2 DISTINCT ION BETWWEN RAPES EED AND MUSTARD SEED  
 
For the purpose s of reporting prices of rapeseed  and mustard seed ; Sarson (Hindustani) , Sarasav

OUR VISION  
To be the best and most i nnovative National Statistical System in the world; and  to 
Effectively Monitor the Programmes and Projects for ensuring efficient use of 
National  Resources.  
NSSTA: NSSTA (erstwhile know as NASA) is to be a Center of Excellence in imparting 
training on Offi cial Statistics and undertaking research activities thereto.  
                                               INTRODUCTION  
 
1) The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) came into 
existence as an independent Ministry on 15th October, 1999 a fter the merger of the 
Department of Statistics and the Department of Programme Implementation. The 
ministry is the nodal agency for the planned and organized development of the 
statistical system in the country and coordination of statistical activities a mong different 
stakeholders in Government of India, State Governments as well as meeting 
requirements of the International Agencies. The Ministry has two wings, viz. Statistics 
Wing, called National Statistics Office (NSO) and Programme Implementation (PI)  
Wing. The Programme Implementation Wing has two Divisions, namely (i) 
Infrastructure and Project Monitoring and (ii) Members of Parliament Local Area 
Development Scheme. Besides these two wings, there is a National Statistical 
Commission (NSC) created thr ough a Resolution of Government of India and one 
autonomous institute viz. Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) which is declared as an 
institute of national importance by an Act of Parliament, known as “Indian Statistical 
Institute Act No. 057 of 1959”.  
 
2) The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation attaches considerable 
importance to coverage and quality aspects of statistics released in the country and uses 
technology to achieve the same. The statistics released by the Ministry are based on 
admin istrative sources, surveys and censuses conducted by the Central and State 
Governments and non -official sources and studies. The surveys conducted by the 
Ministry are based on scientific sampling methods and are supervised by the National 
Statistical Commi ssion. Data is collected through dedicated field staff who are 
regularly trained in the concepts and definitions of the items and the scope of the 
survey. In line  with the emphasis on the quality of statistics released by the Ministry, 
4 
 the methodological i ssues concerning the compilation of national accounts are over 
seen by an Advisory Committee on National Accounts, industrial statistics by a 
Standing Committee on Industrial Statistics and price and cost of living indices by a 
Technical Advisory Committee  on Price Indices. The Ministry compiles data sets based 
on current data, after applying standard statistical techniques and extensive scrutiny and 
supervision.  
 
3) The Administration Division of the Ministry functions as the Cadre Controlling 
Authority of of fices of Indian Statistical Service (ISS) and Subordinate Statistical 
Service (SSS) cadres including matters relating to their training, career progression and 
manpower planning.

Centre within Data Informatics and Innovation Division of NSO of the Ministry. A 
large number of reports of t he Ministry are available on the website for access/use of 
various stakeholders. System of on -line registration has also been introduced for 
downloading/viewing the reports.  
 
7) Statistics Day : In recognition of the notable contributions made by (Late) Profes sor 
Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis in the field of economic planning and statistical 
development, the Government of India has designated 29th June every year, coinciding 
with his birth anniversary, as the Statistics Day in the category of Special Days to be 
celebrated at the national level. The objective of this Day is to create public awareness, 
among the people specially the younger generation for drawing inspiration from (Late)

formulation.  
 
8) The National Accounts Division (NAD)  of the NSO is responsible for preparation of 
national accounts, which include the estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 
National Income, Government/Private Final Consumption Expenditure, Capital  
Formation and Saving along with details of transactions of institutional sectors. NAD 
annually brings out a publication titled “National Accounts Statistics”, containing these 
5 
 statistics. NAD releases annual and quarterly estimates of Gross Domestic Produ ct 
(GDP) from time to time as per pre -specified schedule given in Advance Release 
Calendar.  
 
9) The Consumer Price Index (CPI)  is designed to measure the changes over time in 
general level of retail prices of selected goods and services that household purchas e for 
the purpose of consumption. CPI numbers are widely used as macroeconomic indicator 
of inflation, and also as a tool by government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for 
targeting inflation and monitoring price stability. CPI is also used as deflators in  the 
National Accounts. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses CPI, released by MoSPI, as 
measure of inflation for its bimonthly monetary policy announcement. The NSO, 
MoSPI releases data on Inflation and CPI on 12th of every month (on next working 
day, in c ase of 12th being a holiday). Therefore, time lag in release of this data is only 
12 days. The release contains State -wise comprehensive inflation figures for the usage 
of various stakeholders.  
 
10) International Comparison Programme (ICP)  is the largest stati stical initiative in the 
world under the aegis of United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). The World Bank 
is implementing this programme at global level and Asian Development Bank is the 
nodal implementing agency at Asia Pacific Region. The main objectiv es of ICP are to 
produce Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) and Price level indices and to convert 
volume and per capita measures of GDP into common currencies using PPPs. India has 
been participating in ICP since 1970 and MoSPI is the nodal agency to repres ent India 
in this Programme. The Price Statistics Division (PSD) of National Staistics Office, 
MoSPI is responsible for providing data to ADB for inter -country validations and

(CPWD), Engineers India Limited (EIL), administrative data sources available with 
Ministries etc.  
 
11) The Social Statistics Division  (SSD) of NSO developed a National Indicator 
Framework (NIF) for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with identified data 
sources and periodicity for facilitating the monitoring of the SDGs at national level. 
The framework is dynamic in nature and is reviewed and refined every year. The 
division also  compiles Environment Account using United Nations System of 
Environmental Economic Accounting Framework (UN SEEA Framework). The 
division also collates and compiles statistical information on social, environment and 
multi -domain statistics and brings out various publications to provide data at one -place 
to facilitate policy makers and researchers.  
 
12) India is a subscriber to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Special Data 
Dissemination Standards (SDDS)  and is currently fulfilling the Standards. The 
Ministry maintains an ‘Advance Release Calendar’ for its data categories covered under 
the SDDS, which is disseminated on the Ministry’s website as well as on the 
6 
 Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) of the IMF. The Ministry releases the 
datasets cov ered under the Real Sector of SDDS through press notes and its web -site 
simultaneously.   
                                                            
13) The Ministry is entrusted with the development of indicator framework for 
Sustainable Development Goals (S DGs)  in India to facilitate monitoring of SDGs. The 
Ministry organises technical meetings on a regular basis on various topics to assess the 
data-gaps in the system and the quality of statistics currently released. The NSO staff 
participates in meetings an d seminars organized by international and regional 
organizations, such as, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia 
and the Pacific (UNESCAP), on statistical compilations and international practices.

SURVEYS OF NSSO  
 
Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS):  PLFS is conceptualized to produce periodic data 
on key labour force indi cators to cater to the need of policy makers and researchers. The 
objective of PLFS is primarily of two -fold viz. (i) to measure the labour force indicators in 
the short time interval of three months for the urban areas in the Current Weekly Status 
(CWS) a nd (ii) to generate estimates of all important labour force parameters in both usual 
status (principal status+ subsidiary status) and CWS annually for both rural and urban 
areas. PLFS is a continuous survey undertaken by the Ministry since 2017 and the res ult of 
the survey is released in the form of Quarterly Bulletin (urban) and Annual Report (both 
urban and rural sectors). The survey is conducted in CAPI platform through tablets by field 
enumerators. Till now 20 QBs and 6 Annual reports of PLFS have been released. Latest 
annual report of PLFS for the period July 2022 - June 2023 has been released in October, 
2023.The following QBs of PLFS have been released in 2023:  
 
S.no. Quarterly Bulletin (QBs) (survey period)  Release date  
1.  QB October – December, 20 22 February, 2023  
2.  QB January –March, 2023  May, 2023

Time Use Survey (TUS):  Time Use Survey (TUS) has been conceptualized to gauge the 
time use pattern of individuals to mee t the requirement of different stakeholders. The 
primary objective of Time Use Survey (TUS) is to measure participation of men and 
women in paid and unpaid activities. TUS is an important source of information on thetime 
spent in unpaid caregiving activiti es, volunteer work, unpaid domestic service producing 
activities of the household members. It also provides information on time spent on 
learning, socializing, leisure activities, self -care activities, etc., by the household members. 
The first Time Use Sur vey (TUS) was conducted during January - December, 2019. Report 
of that survey named as “Time use in India – 2019” has been released. The next TUS has 
been launched in January, 2024.  
 
12 
 Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE): Annual Survey  of 
Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) will provide information on unincorporated 
sector enterprises of the country to meet the requirements of the stakeholders. ASUSE is 
designed to have information on the operational and economic 
characteristics  of this sector  for effective policy formulation. At the same time, the 
estimates generated from this survey could be used in National Accounts. The first annual 
survey, namely, ASUSE 2021 -22 was launched from April, 2021 and continued till March, 
2022. Ther eafter, ASUSE 2022 -23 has commenced since October, 2022 and has continued 
till September, 2023 and its data processing work is in progress. The field work of ASUSE 
2023 -24 has been initiated in October, 2023.  
 
Annual Survey of Service Sector Enterprises ( ASSSE) has been conceived to estimate 
key characteristics, such as, Gross Value Added (GVA), fixed capital, Capital formation, 
number of persons engaged, etc. pertaining to the all -important corporate services sector of 
the country. The survey also aims to  bridge the data -gap of non -availability of 
comprehensive database of the services sector of Indian economy. A list frame, using 
GSTN dataset, consisting of corporate service sector enterprises has been developed for 
this survey.  
 
Household Consumption Ex penditure Survey (HCES): Information collected in the 
survey will be primarily used for preparation of weighting diagram through determination 
of budget shares of different commodity groups in total consumption for compilation of 
consumer price indices for  rural and urban India. In addition, statistical indicators of level 
of living, social consumption and well -being, and inequalities therein will also be compiled 
from the data collected in the survey.  
HCES 2022 -24 has been launched in August, 2022. Field w ork for the first year of 
the HCES 2022 –24 has been completed, and the survey is continuing from August 2023 
for a period of one year.  
 
Comprehensive Annual Modular Survey (CAMS):  CAMS aims to cater to the need of 
requirements of a number of Ministries sim ultaneously by focusing on generation of high 
frequency socio -economic indicators combining the requirements of different line 
ministries in a number of modules of questions. It has been launched in the 79th round of 
National Sample Survey (NSS) from July,  2022 to June, 2023.  
 
Annual Survey of Industries (ASI):  Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) is the principal 
source of industrial statistics in India.  The survey is conducted under the statutory 
provisions of the Collection of Statistics (COS) Act, 2008 (a s amended in 2017) and the 
rules framed there -under in 2011. Results of ASI 2019 -20 have been released. Field work 
for ASI 2020 -21 and ASI 2021 -22 has been completed. The field work of ASI 2022 -23 is 
under process.  
 
13 
 Urban Frame Survey (UFS):  Urban Frame Su rvey (UFS) is regularly conducted by Field 
Operations Division (FOD) of MoSPI for formation and updation of UFS blocks for 
providing frame for selection of first stage sampling units in urban sector for use in various 
Socio - Economic Surveys of NSSO.  
 
Note : Digitization of survey instruments and reduction in time lag in National 
Sample Surveys: In respect of systemic improvement and timely publication of data, 
modern IT tools are being adopted for improved data capturing and processing. As a 
part of this, a ll the ongoing NSS surveys are now being conducted in CAPI (Computer 
Assisted Personal Interview), loaded with in -built Computer Scrutiny Points (CSP), 
for data validation at different stages of data capturing which is a cloud based digital 
platform ensuri ng simultaneous data processing. It enables faster validation and 
improved data quality along with the time cycle involved in publishing the survey 
result. This technological improvement caused a drastic reduction in the time lag of 
release of Quarterly Bu lletins (QB) of PLFS from nine months to 2 -3 months from the 
completion of field work. The time lag in release of PLFS Annual Report 2022 -23 has 
also been brought down to around 3 months from 8 months of release of PLFS Annual 
Report 2021 -22 from end of su rvey period.

Standardisation is one of the basic pre -requisites for any statistical production 
process. It helps in making statistical processes more efficient and robust, and to 
improve reporting on the quality of processes and output. Standards support the 
sharing of knowledge -based experiences and methodologies and, consequently, 
the sharing of tools, data, services and resources. The implementation of standard methods and tools, in turn, improves the comparability of statistical outputs, thus 
benefiting users of statistics.  
As a standard, this publication encourages sharing information to Indian official statistics and the spread of best practices, in particular for quality and metadata 
reporting. It aims to promote harmonised quality reporting across National Statis tical System (NSS), and, thus, to facilitate cross- comparisons of processes 
and outputs. The Handbook applies to all the stakeholders of NSS and others in 
their roles as producers, compilers and disseminators of Indian official statistics.  
In its first, M inistry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI), after 
due consultation with the stakeholders of the NSS, notified first edition of 
National Metadata Structure (NMDS) in August 2021. While reporting 
compliance on various elements of NMDS in respec t of statistical products of 
MoSPI, it emerged that there is a need to further distinguish the elements of 
NMDS for surveys/ census , administrative  records/ statistics, and other 
datasets/indices in terms of their appropriate applicability . Further, it was a lso felt 
that various elements of NMDS may also be classified as mandatory and optional 
for reporting purposes. This arrangement is likely to bring to the fore improved 
dissemination of statistical products on various elements of NMDS.   Foreword

 National Statistic s Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation, 
presents and disseminates data and metadata through different products like Census 
data (Economic Census); Survey data such as NSS Surveys viz. Household Surveys, etc, 
Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), Consumer Price Indices (CPI), and macro-economic 
aggregates like National Income, Index of Industrial Production (IIP) . In addition, 
statistical data is presented in analytical publications such as NSS Reports, Annual Survey of Industries Reports, National Indicator Framework (NIF) for monitoring 
SDGs, Energy Statistics, EnviStats India, Women & Men in India etc., which provide analysis of data, supported by the visual presentation of that data in the form of graphs and maps.  
The production of data and presentation of metadata structure requires an overview of 
the arrangements, technical infrastructure and skills required for a holistic and integrated approach to the presentation and dissemination of statistical data and metadata to different user groups. National Metadata Structure (N MDS) is to provide 
guidelines for the data producer to adhere to a basic minimum quality standard in order to establish and maintain the quality of data and enhance ease in sharing data. The 
specific objectives of this document are:  
• to promote reporting for each type of statistical process and its outputs across 
different Ministries/ Divisions/Departments  of NSO, hence facilitating 
comparisons across processes and outputs;  
• to ensure that producer reports contain all the information required to facilitate 
identification of quality issues and potential improvements in statistical 
processes and their outputs; and  
• to ensure that user reports contain all the information required by users to assess 
whether statistical o utputs are fit for the purposes they have in mind.   Introduction

 A.1. Metadata should contain all the information users need to analyse a dataset1 and draw 
conclusions. It increases data accessibility by summarizing the most important 
information (i.e. methodology, sampling design, interview mode, etc.) required for 
analyzing a dataset which alleviates the need for users to search for supporting documen ts 
and reports. Furthermore, good metadata clearly articulates the potential uses for a dataset, preventing potential misuses. Metadata is also a tool for rendering complex 
microdata structures into something meaningful, navigable, and user -friendly. Final ly, 
the adoption of well -known metadata schemas and vocabularies allows for semantic 
interoperability.  
 
 
      
 
The Metadata process is fully integrated in the Generic Statistical Business Process Model2 
(GSBPM) which has metadata as one of the key elements in the version 5.1. 
                                                           
1 The term dataset (also termed as data set) refers to a file that contains one or more records. Any named group of 
records is called a dataset. Datasets can hold information such as medical records or insurance records, to be used 
by a program running on the system. Datasets are also used to store information needed by applications or the 
operating system itself, such as source programs, macro libraries, or system variables or parameters. For datasets 
that contain readable text, one can print them or display them on a console (many data sets contain load modules or other binary data that is not really printable). Datasets can be catalog ued, which permits the data set to be 
referred to by name without specifying where it is stored.

B.1. In most information technology usag es, the prefix of meta conveys “ an underl ying 
definition or description.”  So it is that, at its most basic , metadata is data about data . More 
precisely, however, metadata describes data containing specific information like type, 
length, textual description and other characteristics . Metadata makes it much easier to 
find relevant data and to use a dataset, users need to understand how the data is structured, definitions of terms used, how it was collected, and how it should be read.  
B.2. Metadata is an important way to protect resources  and their future accessibility . For 
archiving and preservation purposes, it takes metadata elements that track the object’s 
lineage, and describe its physical characteristics and behaviour  so it can be replicated on 
technologies in the future. 
 
 
B.3. In today’s modern data driven world and in the era of digital transactions, huge amount of data is generated on real time basis, and lately, a large number of 
organisations/agencies have started producing data, the quantum of which is huge, and 
thus arises  a need of standard regulatory framework to be laid down to assure the quality 
of data produced by different producers. It will also serve the purpose of ensuring data 
B. Why Metadata?

 comparability  across time horizons so as to enable better understanding of different soc ial 
and economic movements. 
B.4. Although metadata may not seem  exciting or impressive, the true importance of metadata 
can never be underrated  and hence, is important to take a concerted effort to build sound 
metadata structure to draw maximum gains from varied data sets .

C.1.  To avoid confusion about which "data" and "metadata" are the intended content of the 
formats specified here, a statement of scope is offered. Statistical "data" are sets of often 
numeric observations which typically have time associated with them. They are  
associated with a set of metadata values, representing specific concepts, which act as 
identifiers and descriptors of the data. These metadata values and concepts can be 
understood as the named dimensions of a multi -dimensional co- ordinate system, 
describ ing what is often called a "cube" of data.  
C.2.  The term "metadata" is very broad indeed. A distinction can be made between 
“structural” metadata – those concepts used in the description and identification of 
statistical data and metadata – and “reference” metadata – the larger set of concepts that 
describe and qualify statistical data sets and processing more generally, and which are 
often associated not with specific observations or series of data, but with entire 
colle ctions of data or even the institutions which provide that data3.

ASPD/Oct/2024/2  
  
 
 
 
D.1. According to terminology agreed to describe types of statistical metadata4, there are 
two types of metadata: structural metadata and reference metadata.  
 
Structural metadata identify and describe data, and reference metadata.  Structural 
metadata are needed to identify, use, and process data matrixes and data cubes, e.g. names 
of columns or D imensions of statistical cubes. Structural metadata must be associated 
with the statistical data and reference metadata, otherwise it becom es impossible to 
identify, retrieve and navigate the data or reference metadata.  
 
 In SDMX structural metadata are not limited to describing the structure of data and  
reference metadata. The structural metadata in SDMX include many of the other 
constructs to be found in the SDMX Information Model including data discovery, data 
and metadata C onstraints (used for both data validation and data discovery), data and 
structure mapping, data and metadata reporting, statistical processes .5 
 Reference metadata descr ibe the contents and quality of the statistical data.  Preferably, 
reference metadata should include all of the following: a) "conceptual" metadata, describing the concepts used and their practical implementation, allowing users to 
understand what the stati stics are measuring and, thus, their fitness for use; b) 
"methodological" metadata, describing methods used for the generation of the data (e.g. 
sampling, collection methods, editing processes); and c) "quality" metadata, describing 
the different quality dimensions of the resulting statistics (e.g. timeliness, accuracy).

This publication is mainly concerned with reference metadata and how they are presented 
to users when data are published.  
 
There must be flexibility in the presentation of metadata, so that statistical products  have 
the level of detail appropriate for the  target audience(s). This document recommends  
metadata that are mandatory (always required); and optional ( data producers are 
encouraged for dissemination but are not mandatorily required )8 for the datasets 
produced through  various sources such as census, survey , administrative data, alternative 
data, as also for the indices, etc.

 E.1. National and international statistical organizations face common challenges in managing 
their metadata, and there has been significant effort to develop shared metadata standards and 
models. Some of the metadata standards which are widely followed are presented hereunder:  
E.2. Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX)9: The Statistical Data and Metadata 
Exchange (SDMX) initiative sets technica l standards and content -oriented guidelines to 
facilitate the exchange of statistical data and metadata. Used by a large number of international 
and national statistical organizations, SDMX is maintained by a group of seven sponsors: The 
Bank for Internati onal Settlements, the European Central Bank, Eurostat, the International 
Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations and the World Bank. 
The introductory document (
https://sdmx.org/wp -
content/uploads/SDMX_COG_2016_Introduction.pdf ) provides a general description of the 
various components of the SDMX Content -Oriented Guidelines, namely: c ross-domain 
concepts, code lists, subject -matter domains, glossary, and implementation -specific guidelines. 
This material is made available to users to enhance and make more efficient the exchange of 
statistical data and metadata using the SDMX standard.  
The SDMX Content -Oriented Guidelines facilitate mutual understanding of the content of the 
SDMX data and metadata files through the use of common statistical concepts in the underlying metadata.  
SDMX regularly reports on its activities to the UN Statistical Commission (UNSC). At the 
39th Session of the Commission in 2008, SDMX was recognized as the preferred standard for 
the exchange and sharing of data and metadata. The Commission also encouraged 
implementation by national and international statistical orga nizations. 
E.3. Data Documentation Initiative  (DDI)
10: The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is an 
international standard for describing the data produced by surveys and other observational

 methods in the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences. DDI is a free standard that 
can document and manage different stages in the research data lifecycle, such as 
conceptualization, collection, processing, distribution, discovery, and archiving. Documenting 
data with DDI facilitates understanding, interpreta tion, and use -- by people, software systems, 
and computer networks.  
There are three different DDI  (https://ddialliance.org/ ) standards:  
o DDI Co debook (DDI- C) 
 Intended to document simple or single survey data 
 Has the same information describing a dataset that would be available 
in the codebook for a dataset 
 Used in the Dataverse data repository  
 Based on XML 
o DDI Lifecycle (DDI -L) 
 Can be used to document each stage of the lifecycle of a dataset  
 Can be used for longitudinal datasets 
 Can describe more than one dataset  
 Based on XML 
o DDI Cross -Domain Integration (DDI- CDI)  
 Suitable for integration of data from different research disciplines or domains (cross- domain) purposes  
 Focuses on data description and process/provenance 
 Handles data from different structure types (wide, long 
multidimensional, key value/big data)  
 Based on UML (Unified Modeling Language)  
 Can be expressed in different syntax representations, for example XML  
ASPD/Oct/2024/2

 The DDI updates their resource documents regularly and incorpor ates into its resource 
materials contemporary developments in the field.  
E.4. Metadata registries ISO  (International Organization for Standardization )/IEC  
(International Electrotechnical Commission ) 1117911- This is a standard for describing and 
managing the meaning and representation of data. The basic semantic unit is a concept. Both 
DDI and SDMX are based on ISO/IEC 11179 for their descriptions of data and their use of 
concepts as a basic semantic unit.  
ISO/IEC  11179 specifies the structure of a Metadata registry and provides a metamodel for 
registry common facilities. This metamodel is intended to be extended by other parts of 
ISO/IEC 11179 for specific purposes ( https://www.iso.org/standard /78914.html ).  
This standardization and registration allow  for easier locating, retrieving, and transmitting data 
from disparate databases. The standard defines the how metadata are conceptually modelled  
and how they are shared among parties, but does not define how data is physically represented 
as bits and bytes.   
E.5. Metadata Common Vocabulary (MCV)12- The Metadata Common Vocabulary (MCV) 
is an SDMX repository which contains concepts (and related definitions) to which terminology used in structural and reference metadata of international organisations and national data 
producing agencies may be mapped. T he MCV covers a selected range of metadata concepts: 
(1) General metadata concepts, mostly derived from ISO, UNECE and UN documents, useful for providing a general context to metadata management;  
(2) Metadata terms describing statistical methodologies (fr equency, reference period, data 
collection, source, adjustment, etc.);  (3) Metadata for assessing quality (accuracy, timeliness, etc.), and  
(4) Terms referring specifically to data and metadata exchange (terminology from the SDMX 
information model and from existing data structure definitions, etc.).

ASPD/Oct/2024/2  
  
 
15 | Page  
 The MCV is not intended to cover the whole range of statistical terminology, as this area is 
already covered by other general and domain- specific glossaries. The focus of the MCV is 
largely those terms that are normally used for building and understanding metadata systems. A metadata glossary is necessarily linked to a series of other subject -speci fic glossaries (on 
classifications, on data editing, on subject -matter statistical areas) or to more universal 
statistical glossaries such as Eurostat’s CODED or the OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms. 
These more extensive glossaries also contain numerous terms and definitions relevant to 
specific statistical domains (such as prices, national accounts, external trade, etc.). The 
insertion within the MCV of some definitions derived from other glossaries should not be seen 
as a redundancy, but as a means of r esolving the complex and interdisciplinary nature of 
metadata.  
E.6. Neuchâtel Terminology Model  (NTM)
13- In 2004, the Neuchâtel Group14 issued 
Neuchâtel Terminology Model Classification database object types and their attributes. The 
main purpose of the work was to arrive at a common language and a common perception of 
the structure of classifications and the links between them. The present document extends the 
model with variables and related concepts. The discussion includes concepts like object types, 
statistical unit types, statistical characteristics, value domains, populations etc. The two models 
together claim to provide a more comprehensive description of the structure of statistical 
information embodied in data items.  
The Terminology Model is both a terminology and a conceptual model. It defines the key

14 The statistical offices of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were among the participants of the IMIM  
(Integrated Metainformation Management System) project of the 4th Framework Programme of the  
EU. The main result of the IMIM project was a software product, BRIDGE, an object -oriented  
system for metadata management. In June 1999, a meeting on terminology was held in Neuchâtel,  
Switzerland, with participants from the statistical offices of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and  
Switzerland and Run Software -Werkstatt (developers of the BRIDGE software) focussing on the  
classification database part of BRIDGE. This was the start of the "Neuchâtel group”.

 The Neuchâtel Terminology Model has a two -level structure, consisting at the first level of the 
object types and, on the second level, the attributes associated with each object type. Both 
object types and their attributes are defined by a textual description. Since the model belongs 
to the semantic and conceptual sphere of metadata, it does not include metadata that are related 
solely to the technical aspects of a variables database. The Neuchâtel Terminology Model is 
generally applicable and not dependent on IT software and platforms. It may be used in any 
context where structured information on variables and their related concepts is required.  
The Neuchâtel Termino logy Model is not just a vocabulary in the sense of a mere collection of 
terms related to the conceptual variable. It has been developed for several purposes, using a 
specific methodology, ordering the concepts in a two- level structure of object types and 
attributes. On the first level, it specifies the object types, while on the second level, it lists the attributes associated with each object type. These attributes refer both to characteristics of the 
object types and to relations with other object types. 
In 2006 the model was extended with variables and related concepts. The discussion includes 
concepts like object types, statistical unit types, statistical characteristics, value domains, 
populations etc. These two models together claim to provide a more comprehensive description 
of the structure of statistical information embodied in data items.  
Metadata standards, models and guidelines form a valuable basis for statistical organizations to develop their data and metadata management systems. Compliance with international 
standards leads to greater consistency and interoperability within the organization. It will also help to exchange and share methods and tools with other organizations, both within the national 
statistical system and internationally. Effectively managing metadata throughout the statistical 
production process is the first step in ensuring sufficient information can be provided to data 
users.

F.1 Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation ( MoSPI ) being a nodal agency for 
planned development of the statistical system in the country  is also responsible for maintaining 
the h ighest standards of data quality which adhere to basic guidelines of International Agencies 
so as to ensure India’s statistical system is one of the frontrunners in quality data producer.  
MoSPI aims at raising the National Statistical System (NSS) to the e pitome of being one of the 
best professionally equipped government data producing agencies by building the best of IT infrastructure among others in the system, and Metadata is one of the building blocks to achieve 
the objective .

G.1 The document in the hand is a set of broad, high level principles that form the guiding 
framework within which metadata management can operate.  
G.2 Once the metadata structure  is put in implementation, metadata should be compiled and 
maintained actively. Otherwise, the currency , and thus use of Metadata will degrade with 
time. To realise the full capabilities of Metadata, it is necessary that the Metadata are 
maintained over a long period of time. Even with investment in technically sophisticated 
search tools, such systems may find the little stakeholders’  acceptance, if the data are 
incomplete or is not updated regularly.

relevance, accuracy and reliability, timeliness and 
punctuality, accessibility and clarity, 
comparability, and coherence.

production process es will fulfil the requirements 
for the statistical output. This includes the design 
of programmes for quality management, the 
description of planning process, scheduling of 
work, frequency of plan updates, and other 
organisational arrangements to support and 
maintain planning function. 
5 Accuracy 
and 
Reliabilit
y Statistics should accurately and reliably portray reality. Accuracy 
of data is the closeness of computations or estimates to the exact 
or true values that the statistics were intended to measure. 
Reliability of the data, defined as the closeness of the initial 
estimated value to the subsequent estimated value.

imperfect selection, bias in response or estimation, 
errors of observation and recording, etc. 
 
For probability sampling, the random variation due 
to sampling can be calculated. For non -probability 
sampling, random errors cannot be calculated 
without reference to some kind of model. The

distribution of the statistic which is being used to 
estimate the parent value.  
5.2 Measures  
of 
reliability  Reliability refers 
to the 
consistency of a 
measure.  Reliability is  how consistently a method measures 
some parameters . When one appl ies the same 
method to the same observation under the same 
conditions, one should get the same results. 
6 Timelines
s Statistics should be made available to users with the shortest delay 
possible and be delivered on the promised, advertised or 
announced dates. The timeliness of the data collection release to 
be compiled.  
6.1 Timeliness  Length of time 
between data 
availability and 
the event or 
phenomenon 
they describe.  Timeliness refers to the speed of data availability, 
whether for dissemination or for further 
processing, and it is measured with respect to the 
time lag between the end of the reference period 
and the release of data. Timeliness is a crucial 
element of data quality: adequate timeliness 
corresponds to a situation where policy- makers 
can take informed decisions in time for achieving 
the targeted results. In quality assessment, 
timeliness is often associated with punctuality, 
which refers to the time lag between the release 
date of data and the target date announced in som e 
official release calendar.  
7 Coherenc
e and 
Compara
bility  Coherence is the degree to which data that are derived from 
different sources or methods, but refer to the same topic, are 
similar. Comparability is the degree to which data can be

ility – over 
time Extent to which 
differences 
between 
statistics can be 
attributed to 
differences 
between the true 
values of the 
statistical 
characteristics.  Comparability aims at measuring the impact of 
differences in applied statistical concepts and 
definitions on the comparison of statistics between 
geographical areas, non -geographical dimensions, 
or over time. Comparability of statistics, i.e. their 
usefulness in drawing comparisons and contrast 
among different populations, is a complex concept, 
difficult to assess in precise or absolute terms. In 
general terms, it means that statistics for different 
populations can be legitimately aggregated, 
compared and interpreted in relation to each other 
or against some common standard. Metadata must 
convey such information that will help any 
interested party in evaluating comparability of the 
data, which is the result of a multitude of factors.

compilation and 
ensuring the 
quality of the 
statistical 
results.  Data validation describes methods and processes 
for assessing statistical data, and how the results of 
the assessments are monitored and made available 
to improve statistical processes.  
 All the controls made in terms of quality of 
the data to be published or already published are 
included in the validation process. Validation also 
takes into account the results of studies and 
analysis of revisions and how they are used to 
improve statistical processes. In this process, two 
dimensions can be distinguished: (i) validation 
before publication of the figures and (ii) validation 
after publication.

identifier(s
)  The unique 
identifier for an 
administered 
item within a  
registration 
authority. 
 
 Identifier is a sequence of characters, capable of 
uniquely identifying that with which it is 
associated, within a specified context.  
 
In order to exchange statistical information, a 
central institution has to agree with its partners 
about which statistical concepts are necessary for 
identifying the series (and for use as dimensions) 
and which statistical concepts are to be used as 
attributes. These definitions form the data structure 
definition. Each data structure definition has the 
following properties: 
a. identifier (providing a unique identification 
within an exchanged time series);  
b. name (also unique); and 
c. description (a description of the purpose and 
domain covered). 
The use of unique identifiers plays a pivotal role in 
the data architecture as it promotes interoperability 
by allowing individual records to be accurately 
linked across data sets (i.e., data linkage). Unique 
identifiers are alphanumeric codes or numbers 
assigned to individuals, cases or entities within a 
system. As implied by the term “unique”, no two 
records should have the same identifier. When 
implementing unique ident ifiers within an 
institution, it is crucial to develop a standardized 
format with fixed naming conventions and 
implement robust validation checks to prevent the 
creation of invalid or duplicate identifiers. Clear 
guidance should also be in place regarding the 
management and retirement of unique identifiers.

1.1  whA t is drought ? 
Drought is a temporary aberration, unlike aridity or even seasonal aridity (in terms of a well-
defined dry season), which is a permanent feature of climate. Drought in contrast is a recurrent, yet 
sporadic feature of climate, known to occur under all climatic regimes and is usually characterized by variability in terms of its spatial expanse, intensity and duration. Conditions of drought appear primarily, though not solely, on account of substantial rainfall deviation from the normal and / or the skewed nature of the spatial / temporal distribution to a degree that inflicts an adverse impact on crops over an agricultural season or successive seasons. What is universally accepted is that drought stems from a deficiency or erratic distribution in rainfall but the spread and intensity of the calamity is contingent on several factors, including the status of surface and ground water resources, agro-climatic features, cropping choices and patterns, socio-economic vulnerabilities of the local population etc.  It is difficult to provide a precise and universally accepted definition of drought due to its complex nature and varying characteristics that manifest across different agro-climatic regions of the world in a myriad different ways.  
Drought differs from other natural hazards such as cyclones, floods, earthquakes, volcanic 
eruptions, and tsunamis in that: 
 y There is no universally accepted definition that can encapsulate the complexity of this phenomenon   adequately;
 y It is difficult to determine the beginning and end of a drought episode because of the slow, ‘creepy’ onset, silent spread and gradual withdrawal. In India, it is generally considered to be coterminous with the monsoons;
 y An episode could spill over months or even years with or without any accompanying shift in the geographical arena; 
 y There is no indicator or index which can precisely forecast the advent and severity of a drought event, nor project its possible impacts;
 y Spatial expanse tends to be far greater than in the case of other natural calamities, which when compounded by the difficulties associated with the impact assessment of the disaster, makes effective response highly challenging;
 y Impacts are generally non-structural and difficult to quantify e.g. the damage to the ecology, the disruption of socio-economic fabric of communities, the long term effects of mal-nutrition on health and morbidity etc.;
 y The impact tends to get magnified in the event of successive droughts.

1.2    drought in indiA
Droughts during the colonial period, tended to degenerate into severe famines causing 
massive human losses. According to one estimate, in the latter half of the 19th century, there were 
approximately 25 major famines across India, which killed 30-40 million people. The first Bengal famine of 1770 is estimated to have wiped out nearly one third of the population. The famines continued until Independence in 1947, with the Bengal famine of 1943–44 which affected 3-4 million people, being among the most devastating.
The situation improved remarkably in post-independent India. Investment in irrigation 
works, promotion and availability of quality inputs, focus on research & extension led to increased agricultural productivity and greater resilience among the farming communities. This development did not only render the country self-sufficient in food production but to a considerable extent, famine proof.  Though population quadrupled since Independence, the country did not witness a famine in the past 69 years and in fact, India has become a major exporter of agricultural produce in the world. 
With the liberalization of the Indian economy in the 1990s, accelerated growth in industry and 
services saw the share of agriculture in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shrink to less than 15% (half its share from a few decades ago), yet the country continued to be largely self-sufficient in food and agri-commodities, gained greater resiliences in absorbing the impact of drought. 
The history of meteorological drought in India is given in Box 1.
Box 1: Meteorological History of Droughts in India
During 1871–2015, there were 25 major drought years, defined as years with All India Summer 
Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) less than one standard deviation below the mean (i.e. anomaly below –10 percent): 1873, 1877, 1899, 1901, 1904, 1905, 1911, 1918, 1920, 1941, 1951, 1965, 1966, 1968, 1972, 1974, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, 2002, 2009, 2014 and 2015. The frequency of drought has varied over the decades. From 1899 to 1920, there were seven drought years. The incidence of drought came down between 1941 and 1965 when the country witnessed just three drought years. However, during the 21 years, between 1965 and 1987, there were 10 drought years which was attributed to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
Among the many drought events since Independence, the one in 1987 was one of the worst, 
with an overall rainfall deficiency of 19% which affected 59–60% of the normal cropped area and a population of 285 million. This was repeated in 2002 when the overall rainfall deficiency for the country as a whole was 19%. Over 300 million people spread over 18 States were affected by drought along with around 150 million cattle. Food grains production registered an unprecedented steep fall of 29 million tonnes. In 2009, the overall rainfall deficiency for the country as a whole was 22%, which resulted in decrease of food grain production by 16 million tonnes. During 2014-15 and 2015-16 large parts of the country were affected by drought causing widespread hardships to the affected population since the calamity encompassed major agricultural States in the country.

1.2.1  Characteristics of Drought
The occurrence of drought is contingent on a number of factors such as cropping choices and 
agronomic practices, soil types, drainage and ground water profiles, to name a few. However, rainfall 
deficiency and spatial and temporal distribution, duration and dry spells are acknowledged as the most important triggers for drought. 
1.2.1.1  Seasonal Characteristics and Intra-Seasonal Variability
India receives most of its rainfall (73%) from the South-West or “summer” Monsoon i.e., (the rainfall 
received between June and September). The summer monsoon sets in during the first week of June in the south-west corner of India and gradually proceeds towards the north-west region covering the entire country by the second week of July. The withdrawal of the Monsoon commences in the first week of September from the west and north and recedes from most parts of the country by the month-end.  Even when the overall rainfall in the country was normal, large variations were noticed across regions, within States, and sometimes, even within districts. IMD set up 36 meteorological sub-divisions straddling over the territories of a dozen districts on an average, in each of the sub-divisions. Rainfall is categorised as excess, normal, deficient or scanty and the possibility of drought arises in the event of deficient or scanty rainfall. 
This pattern of onset (Map 1.1) and withdrawal (Map 1.2) ensures that the duration of the rainy 
season in the north-west region of the country is less than a month on account of the late arrival and early cessation of monsoon activities. Conversely, Kerala and north-eastern parts of India receive more than 4 months of rainfall due to the wide window afforded by the early arrival and late withdrawal of the monsoons.
Coastal areas of peninsular India and Tamil Nadu, in particular, receive bulk of its annual rainfall 
from October to December, from the receding monsoon and periodic cyclonic disturbances in the Bay of Bengal, but primarily on account of the North-East monsoons. The broad seasonal distribution of rainfall in India is presented in Table 1.1.
T able 1.1: Seasonal Distribution of Rainfall in India
Season Period Percentage of Distribution

South-west monsoon June-September 73.4
Post-monsoon (Northeast Monsoon) October-December 13.3
Winter rains January-February   2.9

The Table 1.2 below throws light on the spatial and temporal extent of rainfall deficiencies in the 
South West Monsoon season recorded across meteorological subdivisions in the country during the 
drought years. It would appear that the geographical spread of the drought over meteorological sub-divisions was the maximum in 1987 and 2002 among the drought events in the recent past (Table 1.2). The drought in 2015 too had a very wide coverage, and the impact substantially magnified, by the pervasiveness of the ill effects of a major drought during the immediately preceding year.

Table 1.3 provides a comparison of the extent of departure of rainfall from the normal during 
the recent major droughts in 1972, 1979, 1987, 2002, 2014, 2015. Rainfall variation in 2009 appears 
to be higher compared to other drought years at an all India level. The South West Monsoon Season in 2009 opened in June with an ominous rainfall deficiency of 47%, which was further aggravated by continuing shortfalls in the remaining months. Earlier, during the drought years of 1972, 1979 and 1987 too, a similar pattern was noticed when each of the four months between June and September recorded deficient rainfall at an all India level. In 2014, the first three months of the South West Monsoon were characterized by deficient rainfall to an extent that the late season rally in September was not sufficient to revive agriculture in most parts of the country.  In contrast, the 2015 season started with normal rainfall, prompting farmers to undertake large scale agricultural operations, before the situation turned progressively adverse into a serious drought in the remaining 3 months, causing serious damage to agriculture and losses to the farmers.

1.2.2  Successive Droughts
1.2.2.1  Causes of Recurring Drought in India
A deficiency in rainfall causes depletion of soil moisture, fall in  surface and ground water levels 
which in turn is likely to have a deleterious effect on agricultural operations, due to insufficient 
availability of water for the crops, especially during the critical stages of plant growth. The correlation between quantum of rainfall and the trigger for drought in India vary across agro-climatic zones. In the semi-arid regions, even a well distributed 400 mm rainfall during a crop season could be adequate for the sustenance of crops, while in high rainfall regions like Assam, an annual rainfall of 1,000 mm could still create a potential for drought like development. Though deficient rainfall is considered to be the primary instigating factor for drought, yet the occurrence, spread and intensity is determined by several factors including susceptibilities introduced by climate change, hydrological and soil profiles, availability of soil moisture, choice of crops and agricultural practices, availability of fodder,  socio-economic vulnerabilities etc.
The recurrence of drought in India is owed largely to the unique physical and climatic 
susceptibilities of the country, which include:
 y Considerable annual / seasonal/regional variations in spite of a high average annual rainfall of around 1,150 mm. The mean annual rainfall across the country is shown in Map. 1.4;
 y A relatively short window of less than 100 days during the South-West Monsoon season (June to September) when about 73% of the total annual rainfall of the country is received. The normal rainfall in various parts of the country is shown in Map 1.3;
 y Uneven distribution of rainfall over different parts of the country in that some parts bear an inordinately high risk of shortfalls, while others tend to receive excessive rainfall.  Even though India receives abundant rain on an average, for the country as a whole, much of the excess water, which otherwise could have contributed towards enhancing natural resilience towards drought, gets lost as run-offs. The variability in rainfall exceeds 30% in large areas of the country when compared to Long Period Average (LPA) and exceeds 50% in parts of drought- prone Saurashtra, Kutch and Rajasthan;
 y Low average annual rainfall of 750 mm over 33% of the cropped area in the country heightens the susceptibility to drought;
 y Over-exploitation of ground water and sub-optimum conservation and storage capacity of surface water leading to inadequate water availability for irrigation, particularly in the years of rainfall deficiency. Steady decline in per capita water availability for humans and animals even in non-drought years;
 y Out migration of cattle and other animals from drought hit areas heightens the pressure on resources in surrounding regions.
 y Limited irrigation coverage (net irrigated area in the country is less than 50%) exacerbates the impact of drought on account of complete dependence of agriculture in such areas on rainfall (Map 1.6).

1.2.2.2  The Senario
Poor rainfall in successive years tend to compound the adverse effect of drought by reducing 
scope for the recharge of surface and ground water resources, replenishment of soil moisture and 
recovery of financial capacity of agriculturists to make investments in agricultural operations. Table 1.4 shows the extent of departure of rainfall in the Kharif season during successive drought years.

It is evident from Table 1.4 that at the macro-level, the serious droughts in 1966, 1987, 2002 
and 2015 were a culmination of the build up of adverse rainfall events of the preceding years. It is 
worth noting that in several instances, the low rainfall spells have continued over several years e.g. 1985-87 and 1999-2002 periods. The map 1.5 in Chapter 1 provides a pictographic representation of the frequency of drought occurrences in districts between 2000-2015.  The frequencies are derived from the number of occasions when droughts were declared in such districts by State Governments during the 15-year period. It is hoped that the map will help provide guidance to policy makers in identifying areas that are most susceptible to drought for the establishment of monitoring and early warning systems. In addition, the map will help focus attention of the Central and State Governments to particularly vulnerable areas in order to plan and prioritize mitigation measures through urgent execution of District Irrigation Plans, Crop Contingency Plans, Drinking water and MGNREGS related activities etc. It would appear that certain parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan have been particularly susceptible to drought episodes.

1.2.3 Geographical Spread of Drought
It has been shown that about 68% of cropped area in India is vulnerable to drought, of which 
33% receives less than 750 mm of mean annual rainfall and is classified as “chronically drought-prone” 
while 35% which receive mean annual rainfall of 750-1125 mm is classified as “drought-prone” . The drought-prone areas of the country are confined primarily to the arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid regions of peninsular and western India.

Table 1.6 below indicates that while the droughts in 1965-67 and 1979-80 impacted comparatively 
high rainfall regions, whereas the droughts during 1972, 1987, and 2002 affected mostly semi-arid 
and sub-humid regions. In recent years, central, north-west and peninsular India appear to have suffered frequent drought occurrences. These are traditionally low rainfall zones and the frequent failure of monsoons seems to have aggravated the intensity of droughts in these regions.

Irrigation systems are well developed in some parts of the country as depicted in Map 1.6.  It 
has been noticed that regions bestowed with assured irrigation have tended to escape the adverse 
impact of poor monsoon rainfall to a large extent, as is often the case with many districts of Haryana and Punjab.

1.3   imp Act of drought
Drought produces wide-ranging impacts that span across many sectors of the economy. The 
reverberations are felt by the society and economy much beyond the areas actually experiencing 
the onslaughts of physical drought because agricultural production and water resources are integral to our ability to produce goods and services. Drought affects the overall economy of the country at macro and micro economic levels, both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts are usually visible in falling agricultural production and heightened food insecurity among poor and vulnerable sections; depleted water levels; higher livestock and wildlife mortality; cattle and animal migration; damage to ecosystem from indiscriminate exploitation; increased fire hazards etc. Indirect impacts of drought can be gauged from the reduction in incomes for farmers and agribusinesses, increased prices for food and fodder, reduction in purchasing capacity and slump in consumption, default on agricultural loans, distress sale of agricultural land & livestock, rural unrest, shrinkage in avenues for agricultural employment etc.  These deleterious impulses have huge negative multiplier effects in the economy and society.The impacts of drought are generally categorized as economic, environmental, and social.
Economic impacts refer to production losses in agriculture and related sectors, especially 
animal husbandry, dairy, poultry, horticulture and fisheries. It affects livelihoods and quality of life for the majority of farmers, share croppers, farm labourers, artisans, small rural businesses and rural population in general that is dependent on agriculture. All industries dependent upon the primary sector for raw materials suffer on account of reduced supplies and hardening prices. Drought thus causes a dampening impact on the economy by squeezing profit margins, drying up income and revenue streams and constricting employment avenues through disruption caused to supply chain managements, slowing down flow of credit and tax collections, depressing industrial and consumer demand, increased dependence on imports, and lowering of overall market sentiments.  
Environmental impacts can be gauged from low water levels in ground water and surface 
reservoirs, lakes and ponds, reduced flows in springs, streams and rivers, loss of forest cover, migration of wildlife and sharpening man-animal conflicts and general stress on biodiversity. Reduced stream flow and loss of wetlands may affect levels of salinity. Increased groundwater depletion rates, and reduced recharge may damage aquifers and adversely affect the quality of water (e.g., salt concentration, acidity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity) which in turn may lead to a permanent loss of biological productivity of soils. 
Social impacts are manifest in widespread disruption in rural society on account of out-
migration of the population from drought affected areas, rise in school dropout rates, greater immiseration and indebtedness, alienation of land and livestock assets, malnutrition, starvation and loss of social status among the most vulnerable sections. The situation of scarcity in some cases may exacerbate social tensions and lead to erosion of social capital.

2.1  monitoring And eArly wArning systems
2.1.1 Need
Drought is a complex phenomenon characterized by slow onset. Careful monitoring of the 
symptoms of drought and early warning are key to effective management of the calamity. It is 
essential that along with a drought monitoring system, medium and long term area specific plans be prepared for drought proofing of susceptible areas. In addition, contingency and Crisis Management Plans need to be formulated with care to deal with drought in the short term.  Such well conceived plans, when executed promptly, can go a long way in mitigating distress and disruption to the rural economy and society. The objectives behind an effective monitoring and early warning system are to: 
 y provide accurate and timely information on rainfall, crop sown area, data on soil moisture (wherever possible), stream flow, groundwater, lake and reservoir storage at the relevant spatial scale at the State / district  / sub-district levels.
 y detect drought conditions as early as possible in order to implement District Agriculture Contingency Plans and the Crisis Management Plan.
The development of such a system and its success depends on the coordinated efforts on the 
part of all affected parties viz. Government of India, State Governments, Scientific Institutions and farmers.
Institutional Mechanism for Drought Monitoring and Early Warning at the National and State 
Levels
The Central and State Governments should set up institutional mechanisms for drought monitoring 
and early warning at the National and State levels.  The existing capacities of these institutions 
need to be enhanced and strengthened for the purposes of data collection, analysis, and derive meaningful and actionable conclusions.
The institutional arrangements for drought management at the National and State levels are 
described below:
2.1.2  Institutional Structures
Government of India
1.     Central Drought Relief Commissioner (CDRC):
Additional Secretary in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) serves as the CDRC and is assisted by the Disaster Management (DM) Division in the Department. A Drought Management Cell in the DM Division is created to help collate information for diverse sources, monitor drought conditions, issue advisories, coordinate with other Ministries of the Central Government, State Governments and relevant agencies to mitigate/combat the effect of drought. 
20MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
2.    Crop Weather Watch Group
The Crop Weather Watch Group (CWWG), in the DAC&FW, can act as an Inter-Ministerial mechanism, 
which should meet at least once a week during June to September period to monitor drought situation in the country. The composition of the Group and the specific areas of responsibility are suggested in Table 2.1 below.

This system would provide an integrated approach to drought management covering all aspects 
of drought: early warning and forecast, response and mitigation. The monitoring and early warning 
/ forecasting systems are discussed below. Response and mitigation measures will be discussed in subsequent sections.
State Government:
1.  State Drought Monitoring Centres :
The State Governments to consider setting up of Drought Monitoring Centres (DMCs) staffed 
by a multi-disciplinary team of meteorologists,  hydrologists and agriculture scientists to 
provide critical inputs to the State Executive Committee / State Disaster Management Departments / Other Institutional Structures established by the States. The DMCs will collect, collate and analyse information on drought parameters from National and State level agencies e.g., the IMD, NRSC/SRSCs, MNCFC, CWC, CGWB, State agricultural department etc. 
22MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
The outline for setting up DMCs at the State levels is provided in Annex 2 . The State Governments 
can consider introducing suitable modifications in the constitution of these centres, taking 
into consideration their specific needs of drought monitoring. The DMCs will process the inputs received from sources to advise the State Governments/State Executive Committees(SECs) of any critical developments on drought. 
Scientific & Support Organisations:
1.  India Meteorological Department (IMD)
IMD provides, inter alia, national weather based services for weather-sensitive activities like 
agricultural and is the principal government agency in all matters related to meteorology, seismology and allied subjects. IMD provides following weather forecasts;
 y All India Weather Forecasts: It includes meteorological sub-division wise 5 day rainfall forecasts for 36 sub-divisions. 
 y Monsoon Forecasts: Operational forecasts for the South West Monsoon season (June – September) rainfall are issued in two stages. The first stage forecast is issued in April and the second stage forecast is issued in June. In the first stage, a forecast is made for the seasonal rainfall in the country as a whole, while in the second stage, forecasts are made for the four homogenous regions and for June-July period.  
 y Severe Weather Warning: Meteorological sub-division wise 5 day extreme weather warnings are issued.
 y   District-wise rainfall Forecasts:  3 day district-level forecasts for rainfall are made.
In addition to these forecasts, IMD also issues other forecasts such as 3 hour now-casts for severe 
weather, specialized forecasts for tourism, highway, mountain weather, etc. 
Under Agro-Advisory Services, the Agricultural Meteorology Division of IMD (located at Pune), 
provides district level 5-day forecasts and crop wise agro-advisories. These advisories are prepared in collaboration with Agro-Met Field Units (AMFU), located in State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and ICAR centres. 
2.  Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre(MNCFC)
MNCFC was established as an attached office of DAC&FW in 2012 to use space technology for 
agricultural assessment. MNCFC, operationally, carries out drought assessment and monitoring 
under the National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS) after the technology was transferred from the National Remote Sensing Centre in the Department of Space (Government of India).  District/sub-district level monthly drought assessments are carried out for 14 major drought-prone agricultural States of India under the NADAMS project. The drought assessment is carried out in the MNCFC using long-term satellite data (NOAA-AVHRR, MODIS, Resourcesat  
2 AWiFS) on multiple vegetation indices, Rainfall Deficiency (or SPI) using meteorological data, Soil Moisture Index (from agro-meteorological modeling and satellite data), irrigation statistics and sown area figures. The monthly reports are made available in the public domain (www.ncfc.gov.in) for use of all concerned States and National agencies.
23MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.  Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA)
The CRIDA, Hyderabad and the All India Coordinated Research Projects on Agro-meteorology 
and Dryland Agriculture  (AICRP AM and AICRPDA), each with 25 centres under SAUs across the 
country take part in drought studies pertaining to assessment, mitigation, risk transfer , 
and development of decision support software for drought-prone States.  CRIDA has prepared comprehensive District Agriculture Contingency Plans for more than 600 districts in the country, which State Governments and district level authorities can use as guidance documents to deal with drought.
4. Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR)
The Central Water Commission (CWC) and the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) under the 
(MoWR, RD & GR) are the two lead organizations in the country which monitor reservoir and ground 
water status. The data on river flows, reservoir storage levels and groundwater status can prove to be extremely useful in making a realistic assessment of water availability for agricultural crops in the event of drought like developments.  
5. Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO): 
ISRO is a premium organization of the country with the mission to harness space technology 
for national development. Two major centres of ISRO viz., Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad 
and National Remote Sensing Centres, Hyderabad carry out applications related to remote sensing, including those in agriculture. These Centres, along with 4 Regional Remote Sensing Centres, located in Bengaluru, Kolkata, Jodhpur and Nagpur can provide R&D and technical support for drought assessment/monitoring activities through satellite data products available on Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC) and Bhuvan platforms. The satellite derived products available on Bhuvan (http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/) can be useful for drought assessment, including the computation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Soil moisture etc. 
6.  State Remote Sensing Application Centres (SRSACs)
Most State Governments have established state level Remote Sensing Application Centres 
realizing the potential of remote sensing techniques. Many of these centres have matured over a 
period of time with required infrastructure and human resources for carrying out remote sensing applications including those critical for agriculture. These centres have not only participated in many national level programmes but have developed valuable State level geospatial database. These centres can help the State Governments in satellite data analysis for agricultural drought assessment. 
2.1.3 Key Variables for Monitoring Drought
State Governments monitor drought by obtaining information from various sources on key 
variables of drought which include rainfall, reservoir / lake water levels, surface water / groundwater, soil moisture and sowing / crop conditions  etc. 
 y Meteorological Data – Rainfall and other parameters like Temperature, Wind speed and Relative Humidity (subject to availability)

Data Sources for Key Variables
Rainfall
The IMD and State Governments collect data on rainfall every day during the rainy season. The 
IMD maintains its network of weather stations throughout the country. Within the State Government, data are collected at the Tehsil / Taluka / Block level(s), generally by the Revenue Department which is entrusted with the responsibility of collecting rainfall data at the district and Tehsil levels. The actual rainfall is compared with the Long Period Average (LPA), which is standardized on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Such a comparison provides information on the deficit or excess of rainfall in a particular sub-division for a certain period. Satellite derived rainfall products, such as those from INSAT 3D and      INSAT 3DR can also be used to assess deviation of rainfall at spatial scales in different time scales (daily, weekly and fortnightly).  
Daily rainfall information could be collected and submitted in Form No. 1, included in the 
Annex 1. 
Storage Water Levels in Reservoirs
Reservoir storage data is an useful indicator for water availability. Since reservoir storage data is 
available on a regular basis, it may help provide clear indication of possible water shortages in areas 
dependent on the surface water storage systems. The Central Water Commission (CWC) monitors and compiles reservoir storage data for 91 major reservoirs in the country (http://www.cwc.nic.in/rsms/index.asp ). A periodic report on available live reservoir storage for 91 major reservoirs in the country 
is published by CWC regularly (http://www.cwc.nic.in/).  In addition, the water resources departments in the States monitor daily reservoir level data for important reservoirs/tanks etc. State Governments need to plan for the use of reservoir storage as per their reservoir operation rules, which ought to lay down the priority for the use of available water among competing demands, e.g. drinking, urban and industrial use, irrigation, etc. 
Information on water storage in important State /Union Territory owned reservoirs by the State/
UT authorities could be provided in Form No. 2(A), included in Annex 1.
Stream Flow Data Monitoring
The CWC carries out extensive stream flow data monitoring in the country. The CWC has 
established a network of hydrological observation stations in all major river basins. Hydro-
Meteorological Sites (HMS) of CWC are stations responsible for generating the stream flow data.  Recently, a web based water resources information system called ‘India-WRIS’ has been developed 
25MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
and information on the water resources in the country, including observed stream flow data for all 
unclassified river systems is available in the public domain (http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wris.html). The stream- flow data for restricted/classified river systems can be obtained for this purpose by State Governments. Information on Stream Flow Data may be collected in Form 2(B) in Annexure-1.
Groundwater Level
The groundwater table depth below ground level is one of the important factors responsible 
for contribution of base flow in streams, ponds and lakes particularly during dry non rainy season. Similarly, groundwater levels are also affected due to occurrence of low recharge, either due to lack of adequate rainfall or poor water conservation practices. 
The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), and the State Groundwater Departments monitor 
groundwater table (GWT) depths across the country. This monitoring is usually done during pre and post monsoon seasons.  In various States, GWT depth is monitored four times a year, whereas in some regions, the GWT depths are monitored on monthly time scale. Form 2(c) in Annexure-1 provides a template for collection and monitoring of information on groundwater. 

26MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Sowing and Crop Conditions
An important indicator of drought is the total area sown. The State Government agriculture 
departments provide information on sowing on a weekly basis. A delayed sowing indicates rainfall 
deficiency and is a portent for the onset of drought. Reports on crop conditions also provide an indication of the severity of the drought situation e.g. wilting of crops signifies soil moisture stress.  The agriculture contingency plans and other mitigation measures are activated on the basis of reports on different crops sown during the monsoon.
Weekly Information on the area and crop-wise sowing can be provided in Form No. 3 and Form 
No. 4 respectively.  These forms are included in the Annex 1.

Standardized Precipitation Index
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a relatively new drought index based only on 
precipitation. The SPI assigns a single numeric value to precipitation, which can be compared across 
regions and time scales with markedly different climates. This spatial and temporal flexibility allows the SPI to be useful in both short-term agricultural and long-term hydrological applications. 
Reservoir Storage Index
The Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) integrates reservoir storage, stream-flow, and two 
precipitation types (snow and rain) at high elevations into a single index number. SWSI is relatively easy to calculate and it gives a representative measure of water availability across a river basin or selected region/province. It is, however, unlikely that it could be successfully used for large regions with significant spatial hydrological variability since the weights may differ substantially from one part of the region to another.
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is based on the concept that vegetation vigour is 
an indicator of water availability or lack thereof.  It demonstrates the effects of climate on vegetation 
27MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
in terms of its absorptive capacity in visible light but little in the near-infrared spectrum. The difference 
of visible and near-infrared reflectance represents photosynthetically active vegetation; this information is used to construct a vegetation index. The lowering of the vegetation index indicates moisture stress in vegetation, resulting from prolonged rainfall deficiency. High NDVI values might reflect ideal growing conditions if vegetation greenness is higher than that encountered in other years.
Normalized Difference Wetness Index
Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWI) is expected to give the vegetation or crop turgidity 
and health. It is based on the use of Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) band, which is sensitive to moisture available in soil as well as in crop canopy. In the beginning of the cropping season, soil background is dominant which makes SWIR sensitive to soil moisture in the top 1-2 cm. As the crop progresses, SWIR becomes sensitive to leaf moisture content. NDWI using SWIR can complement NDVI for drought assessment particularly in the beginning of the cropping season. Higher values of NDWI signify more surface wetness.
Moisture Adequacy Index
The Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI) is obtained from weekly water balance. Drought impact 
is related to moisture availability at certain crop growth stages. Hence, categories of MAI (severity) at different growth stages are integrated into a single index value to identify drought impact on a particular crop. The Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Jodhpur monitors agricultural drought in the Indian arid regions by using MAI.
Levels of Early Warning
 The early warning system should include the following:
1.  Receipt of forecasts, early warning signals, and advisories from scientific institutions;
2.  Monitor key drought indices at the National / State / District / Sub-district levels using composite 
index of various drought indicators;
3.  Efficient dissemination of early warning so as to activate contingency measures.
Capacity Development for Drought Monitoring
The States are advised to undertake capacity building activities from time to time for all the 
stakeholders engaged in drought monitoring, response and mitigation with the support of relevant National and State Institutes.

      3.1   rAtionAle And objectives
‘Drought declaration’ signifies the beginning of Government response to conditions representing 
a drought situation. The decision to declare drought over a specified administrative unit (District/
Taluka/Tehsil/ Block/Gram Panchayat level) should be guided by objective parameters and made without undue delay so that relief assistance and concessions can be provided to the drought-affected people in time. 
There is substantial variance in the quality of drought monitoring and the methodology and 
parameters adopted in the declaration of drought among States. Many States still continue to rely on the traditional practice such as the annewari/ paisewari/ girdawari systems of eye estimation and crop cutting experiments to assess if the extent of damage to crops warranted a declaration of drought. In such cases, the final annewari/ paisewari/ girdawari estimates for kharif crops are generally available by December or after, whereas those for rabi crops are available not before March. Relief operations are mounted in drought affected areas by the State Governments after the notification of drought using, inter alia, funds available under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).  In the event of drought of a severe nature, the State Government may seek assistance from the Central Government including financial assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).
The Central Government dispatches inter-ministerial teams to carry out assessment of drought 
and recommend the quantum of relief only after the State Government issues a notification of drought and submits a Memorandum for financial assistance from the NDRF.  Therefore,  delay on the part of State Governments in making the determination and declaration of drought on account of the preference for extensive field surveys and crop cutting experiments over other quicker means, is likely to set a train of delays in motion, making it difficult for the much needed relief to reach the affected population in time. The Government of India revised its norms in 2015 to lower the eligibility threshold from 50% loss to 33% loss to sown crops on account of drought to qualify for relief assistance. It was, however, noticed that some States still continue to recognise a minimum loss/damage of 50% to sown crops (i.e, annewari /paisewari/ girdawari less than 50%) for the declaration of an area as drought affected. 
Technological advances have to a large extent, obviated the need for complete and sole 
dependence on crop loss assessment based on  annewari / paisewari / girdawari or crop cutting assessments in the determination of drought.  It is possible to arrive at an objective, timely and accurate assessment of drought through the establishment of an elaborate scientific drought monitoring system. Meteorological, remote sensing and hydrological data can be accessed by the State Governments from Central and State agencies, and processed quickly to arrive at fairly credible inferences on the emergence and intensification of drought-like conditions in any part within their territories. 
It is acknowledged that a combination of carefully chosen indicators and indices derived from 
satellite / hydrological observations is capable of identifying areas with drought like propensities which will be discussed in the course of this Chapter.  However, it needs to be conceded that drought, as opposed to most other calamities, is a highly complex phenomenon, and available technology not only has inherent limitations but the shortcomings are sometimes compounded by poor availability of reliable data.
32MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.2  broAd indices And fActors
On the basis of wide-ranging consultations with domain specialists, five categories of indices 
are recommended for developing a monitoring matrix for drought. The five categories of indices 
are Rainfall, Vegetation, Water, Crop and others. Rainfall is considered to be the most important indicator and therefore related meteorological data should be mandatorily considered in making any assessment of drought. The other indices are to be evaluated in conjunction with the rainfall related data to assess the impact of rainfall deficiency. 
State Governments are expected to develop monitoring systems at the smallest administrative 
unit levels (e.g. Hobli/ sub-division/ Tehsil/ Taluk/ Block/Mandal/ Gram Panchayat etc.), to enable generation of sharper and credible observation data that are reflective of ground realities. In addition, agencies of Central and State Governments would be required to streamline and strengthen data collection system for drought variables. In addition, Standard Operating Procedures need to be considered for collection, updation of data related to the drought variables. 
3.2.1: Rainfall Related Indices
As mentioned earlier, Rainfall is the most important indicator in the determination of drought. 
A departure in rainfall from its normal value in terms of magnitude and distribution i.e., from the Long Period Average (LPA) of 30 years or more is considered as fairly credible indicator of drought     (Table-3.1).  In addition, other indicators such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and occurrence of Dry Spells are also recommended. SPI is used as an indicator of deviation of rainfall from the normal and can serve as a more robust statistical indicator under certain conditions as compared to simple rainfall deviations. Dry spell, in contrast, is an indicator of anomalies in the distribution of rainfall.  
A.  Rainfall Deviation: The rainfall deviation (RFdev) which is expressed in percentage terms is 
calculated as below:
RFdev = {(RFi – RFn)/RFn}*100
Where RFi is current rainfall for a comparable period (in mm) and RFn is the normal rainfall (at 
least 30 years average) for the same period (in mm). The IMD classification of rainfall deviation is given in Table-3.1. 
Table 3.1: Categories of Rainfall Deviations (IMD)
Deviation from Normal Rainfall (%) Category
+ 19 to -19 Normal
-20 to -59 Deficient
-60 to -99 Large Deficient
-100 No Rain
33MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
	 A	major	limitation	 is	sometimes	 posed	by	the	absence	of	long	term	rainfall	data,	especially	 at	sub-
district	levels.	This	obstacle	can	be	overcome	 to	some	extent	by	making	use	of	data	for	a	minimum	
of	five	normal	rainfall	years	to	calculate	 the	average	or	the	IMD	gridded	rainfall	data	(0.25o
 	X	0.25o). 
This parameter needs to be considered with caution in extreme high and low rainfall regions.
B.   Dry Spell: A dry spell is a short period, usually 4 weeks (upto 3 weeks in case of light soils), of low 
rainfall or no rainfall. Thus, consecutive 3-4 weeks after the due date for the onset of monsoon with rainfall less than 50% of the normal in each of the weeks is defined as a Dry spell. This indicator is important in that it quantifies the extent of intra-season rainfall variations which is so critical for the health of crops and maintenance of soil and hydrological regime. In regions normally associated with high rainfall (south west monsoon rainfall >1400mm), the dry spell criteria may need to be recalibrated in synch with the agro-climatic conditions.
C.   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) expresses the actual rainfall as a standardized departure with respect to rainfall probability distribution function and hence, the index has gained importance in recent years as a potential drought indicator permitting comparisons across space and time. The computation of SPI requires long term data on precipitation to determine the probability distribution function (gamma distribution) which is then transformed to a normal distribution with zero as mean and standard deviation of one. The longer the reference period to calculate the distribution parameters, the greater the likelihood of obtaining more accurate results (e.g. 50 years data will be better than that for 30 years). Thus, the values of SPI are expressed in standard deviations, positive SPI indicating greater than median precipitation and negative values indicating less than median precipitation. SPI can be ideally calculated on the basis of a minimum of 30 years of historical data for a station. SPI should be computed only for the monthly time scale.   Fitting appropriate statistical distribution to the time series rainfall data is critical for an accurate SPI computation and interpretation with the help of expert advice. However, sparse availability of long term Block/Taluk/Mandal level quality data in many States is a limitation in computation of SPI. The States are advised to refer to URL of IMD viz. imdpune.gov.in  for SPI data and related information.

3.2.2 Remote Sensing based Vegetation Indices
Advancements in satellite remote sensing technology has enabled regular monitoring of crop 
conditions/vigour over large regions.  Among the various spectral vegetation indices commonly derived from remote sensing data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is most widely used for operational assessment of drought owing to the ease in calculation and interpretation and also its ability to partially compensate for the effects of atmosphere, illumination geometry etc. NDVI is derived using the formula (NIR – Red) / (NIR + Red), where NIR and Red are the reflectance in visible and near infrared channels. Water, clouds and snow have higher reflectance in the visible region and consequently NDVI assumes negative values for these features. Bare soil and rocks exhibit similar reflectance in both visible and near IR regions and the index values are near zero. The NDVI values for vegetation generally range from 0.2 to 0.6, the higher index values being associated with greater green leaf area and biomass.
 Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) band is sensitive to moisture available in soil as well as in crop canopy. 
In the beginning of the cropping season, soil background is dominant hence SWIR is sensitive to soil moisture in the top 1-2 cm. As the crop growth progresses, SWIR becomes sensitive to leaf moisture content. SWIR band provides only surface wetness information. Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWI), computed using SWIR data, can complement NDVI for drought assessment particularly in the beginning of the cropping season. NDWI is derived as follows: NDWI = (NIR-SWIR) / (NIR+SWIR) where, NIR and SWIR are the reflected radiation in Near-Infrared and Shortwave Infrared channels. Higher values of NDWI signify more surface wetness.
Satellite based crop condition anomalies which point towards agricultural drought can be 
generated by computing Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) or NDVI/NDWI deviations from the normal years. Normal NDVI/NDWI is generated by averaging the NDVI/NDWI of at least 3 recent normal years. Such comparisons enable minimization of the effect on account of the differences in cropping pattern and crop calendar.
NDVI
dev = {(NDVIi – NDVIn)/NDVIn}*100
NDWIdev = {(NDWIi – NDWIn)/NDWIn}*100
Where subscript ‘n’ refers to normal value and ‘i’ to current period.
35MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
The value so obtained for a given NDVI o r  N D W I  ranges from–1 to +1. A negative number or 
a number close to zero is indicative of poor vegetation and a number close to >0.6—1.0 signifies 
healthy vegetation in the case of NDVI and absence of water stress in the case of NDWI. 
NDVI/NDWI deviation of -20 to -30% represents moderate drought conditions and that of <-30% 
represents severe conditions. However, these values may be different for different agro-ecological regions and cropping patterns. 
To combine the NDVI and NDWI deviation category, the poorest among the two will be used, for 
example, if NDVI deviation is moderate and NDWI deviation is ‘Severe’ , then overall category will be ‘severe’ .
The current period values of Vegetation and Wetness index values can be compared with long-
term data (at least ten years) by computing Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). The VCI compares the observed NDVI and NDWI to the range of values observed for the same period in previous years. The VCI is expressed in %age and gives an idea where the current value is placed within the extreme values (minimum and maximum) in the historical datasets normalized to a scale of 0 – 100%. Lower and higher values indicate bad and good vegetation state conditions, respectively. VCI is computed as under:
VCI (NDVI) = [(NDVI
curr-NDVImin)/(NDVImax-NDVImin)] x 100     
VCI (NDWI) = [(NDWIcurr-NDWImin)/(NDWImax-NDWImin)] x 100     
Where the subscript ‘curr’ refers to Current Period Value, ‘min’ and ‘max’ refer to minimum and 
maximum values of VI in historical dataset for the same period and same location.
For using VCI in drought assessment following threshold values can be used as given in Table 3.3.
Table 3.3: Classification of Vegetation Condition based on VCI value
VCI Value (%) Vegetation Condition
 60-100 Good
40-60  Fair
0-40 Poor
While combining VCI of NDVI and NDWI, the minimum of the two values can be taken, i.e if at 
least one is in ‘very poor’ condition, the category will be considered as severe. If both are ‘poor’ or at least one is ‘poor’ , then the category will be taken to be Normal.
VCI is a promising index in that it has the advantage of being comparable over space and time 
on account of the normalization of differences in cropping patterns, crop calendars, atmospheric parameters. The limitation arises from the requirement of long term time series data for NDVI/NDWI (at least 10 years) and the risk of VCI values getting affected by the differences in cropping patterns, crop calendars and atmospheric parameters. The computation and interpretation of VCI is complex and require the services of experts (from SRSCs/NRSC/MNCFC). 
36MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
The data for the current season and historical NDVI/NDWI may be sourced from State Remote 
Sensing Centres / MNCFC / NRSC / NDVI / NDWI data of moderate spatial resolution is recommended 
for agricultural drought assessment at sub-district level. The best possible spatial resolution should be preferred (Resourcesat AWiFS of 56m resolution or MODIS with 250m / 500m resolution). Use of coarse resolution data of 1 km is not desirable for sub-district level assessments. VCI data needs to be interpreted with caution when the crops are in maximum vegetative phase. It may be borne in mind while using satellite based vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) that these indices may provide good indication of crop condition and bio-mass, which may not always offer close proximation of the estimate of crop yield.  
The National Agricultural Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS), developed by 
the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), and currently being implemented by the Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) issues fortnightly/ monthly drought assessment reports on detailed crop condition during the kharif season for 14 agriculturally important and vulnerable States such as Andhra Pradesh,  Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh at present. These reports provide values for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI).
3.2.3   Crop Situation Related Indices
3.2.3.1  Area Under Sowing
The extent of sowing is an important indicator of the spread and severity of drought. Sowing 
operations are linked to rainfall and availability of water during initial growth stage. Farmers in rainfed regions commence sowing operations mostly with the onset of the monsoon. If sowing fails due to water stress, farmers tend to  sow a second or even a  third time. Therefore, the area under sowing provides reliable information on the availability of water for agricultural operations.
Drought conditions could be said to exist if the total sown area under kharif crops was less than 
33.3% of the total normal sown area by the end of July/August, depending upon the schedule for sowing in individual States due to failure of rains or very late arrival of monsoon. In such situations, even if rainfall revives in the subsequent months, there is little possibility of full recovery and the agricultural production is likely to take a substantial hit.   However, the conditions will indicate portents for drought of a ‘severe’ nature will appear strong, if the area under crops falls to 50% of the normal by the end of July / August.  State Governments should, therefore, consider the status of  coverage by the end of July/August to see if the shortfall in sown area is significantly short of the total normal sown area.

37MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.2.3.2 Soil Moisture Based Indices
Available soil moisture is a very relevant indicator of drought, especially in rainfed regions. The 
soil moisture based indices could be calculated using a simple region wide soil-moisture balance 
methodology which entails collecting some of the base-line data related to soil properties, climatic parameters and crop growth pattern. Basically, soil moisture balance calculates the amount of rainfall available to crops depending upon crop water requirement, climatic evaporative demand and soil water holding capacity. This calculation may be carried out by involving technical experts like Agro-meteorologists / Agricultural Physicists / Agricultural Engineers working with State Departments of Agriculture or State Agricultural Universities or ICAR institutes located in the States. It is suggested that one of the two soil moisture based indices viz., (a) Percent Available Soil Moisture (PASM), or (b) Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI) is used. These indices may be calculated at weekly intervals and averaged over dominant crop growth stages such as “Early Growth Stage” , “Vegetative Growth Stage” and “Reproductive Stage” . These indices should be combined with other indicators for the determination of drought.
Though soil moisture is an important parameter governing crop growth, there is only a 
rudimentary network of agro-meteorological observatories which record soil moisture regularly. These agro-meteorological observatories are in many cases, located at /or operated with the assistance of State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) or Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institutes.  Satellite transmitted data from existing network of ISRO Agro-Met Stations (AMS) and those stations proposed by IMD can provide valuable insight into the soil moisture and moisture adequacy in agricultural systems. However, soil moisture is highly dynamic in space and time and is measured using soil sensors or satellite remote sensing. Agro-meteorological models have been developed for the estimation of soil moisture, yet the limitation of these parameters stem from the fact that the information is limited to the top-soil and at a very coarse resolution.   
The data on the following needs to be collected at weekly intervals for computing soil moisture 
based indices with the aid of agro-meteorological models. 
(i) Soil water constants: These are static soil properties of Field Capacity (FC), Permanent Wilting 
Point (PWP) constants and soil depth of the dominant soil type in the region. These may be 
obtained from the State Departments of Agriculture or inferred from soil maps prepared by ICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS&LUP) or Soil and Land Use Survey of India (SLUSI) in the DAC&FW.   These constants can be calculated from soil texture data using pedo-transfer functions (i.e. relationship  between soil water contents and sand/silt/day content) if the said organizations are unable to provide the requisite data. 
(ii) Crop Calendar : The normal growth period (sowing and harvesting time) for the one/two 
dominant crops in the region and durations of the “Early Growth Stage” , “Vegetative Stage” and “Reproductive Stage” .
(iii) Weather Parameter: In season rainfall data.
(iv) Climatic data: It relates to the climatic water demand of the atmosphere and is captured in 
terms of the Climatic Potential Evapo-transpiration (PET) / Reference Evapo-transpiration (RET) of the region. These are calculated by IMD / State Irrigation Departments / State Agricultural Universities/ICAR institutes using climatic data and standard methodologies.  
38MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
(A)   Percent Available Soil Moisture (PASM)
PASM is derived from observed moisture sensor data or sample soil-water balance model 
following the ‘bucket approach’ and using the following formula:
PASM = [(SMw - PWP) / (FC - PWP)] * 100
Where SMw is the weekly calculated volumetric soil moisture (vol/vol) for the current week, FC 
is the field capacity of soil (vol/vol) and PWP is the permanent wilting point of the soil (vol/vol). The 
PASM based classification is given in Table 3.4.
PASM is an useful indicator of agricultural drought. However, the limitations stem from the 
lack of representative large area soil moisture measurements or data on soil and meteorology. It is suggested that the States invest in setting up Soil Moisture Monitoring Stations and automated rain gauges as part of a drought monitoring system. 
Table 3.4: Classification of Agricultural Drought based on PASM(%)
PASM (%) Agricultural Drought Class
76 – 100 No drought
51-75 Mild drought
26-50 Moderate drought
0-25 Severe drought
* The ranges and class may be suitably modified by the State depending upon the local dominant crop types, soil properties, etc. in 
consultation with experts.
(B)   Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI)
Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI) is also based on a calculation of weekly soil water balance, and 
is equal to the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of Actual Evapo-transpiration (AET) to the Potential/
Reference Evapo-transpiration (PET or RET) following a soil–water balancing approach during different phenological stages of a crop. Thus, MAI is obtained by using the following equation: 
MAI = [AET/PET] * 100
The MAI values and corresponding drought classes are expressed in Table 3.5 below. 
Table 3.5: Classification of Agricultural Drought based on MAI (%)

3.2.4  Hydrological Indices 
Depletion in stream-flow, reduction in reservoir storages / water spread area and the rate of 
ground water table depletion can serve as useful indicators of drought. These indices are subject to availability of relevant data from Central Water Commission (CWC), the Central Ground Water Board and State agencies, etc.
3.2.4.1 Reservoir Storage Index (RSI)
The availability of water in reservoirs can act as an effective foil against drought. The reservoir 
storage status derived from percentage of storage deficit vis-à-vis long term averages can provide 
an indication of drought (Table 3.6). 
Table 3.6: Category of deficit based on %age deficit in live storage volume of reservoir
Percentage deficit in live storage volume of reservoir w.r.t. 
Average Storage of last 10 yearsCategory of deficit
Less than 20% Normal deficit
20-30% Mild  deficit
30-40 % Moderate deficit
40 – 60% Severe deficit
>60% Extreme deficit
However, the CWC monitors storage data of selected major reservoirs only. Real / near real time 
data from minor / medium storage reservoirs, if gathered by the State Governments, can be useful 
in making assessments of hydrological drought and the possible impact on irrigated crops. Similarly, developing rainfall-run off relationship models will help in prognostic assessment of surface water availability. States may consider installing stream gauging stations - one for every 100 sq km to help develop prognostic tools for understanding supply availability vis a vis demand.
The storage records are maintained for select reservoirs and therefore an obvious limitation of 
RSI is that the application of this index can be useful only for those areas that are dependent for their agriculture on reservoir supplies. 
40MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.2.4.2 Groundwater Drought Index (GWDI)
The rate of depletion of groundwater table is useful for making an assessment of groundwater 
availability for agriculture and drinking water supply purposes.   
 The monthly groundwater (GW) table records are required for a minimum period of 10 years 
for computation of mean value of monthly ground water depletion rate.  When rate of depletion of 
groundwater table in a given month/period is more than the corresponding mean value then it is an indication of water deficit. The computation procedure for Ground  Water Drought Index (GWDI) is as follows:  
Where, 
GWDIij = Groundwater Drought Index  for ith month and jth year.MGWDj = Mean depth to groundwater table below surface (in meter)GWDij = Depth to groundwater table in  ith month and jth year (in meter).GWDimax = Maximum depth to groundwater table in  ith month in available data set for n number 
of years (in meter).
i  = 1, 2, 3, 4, …………, 12.  j  = 1, 2, 3, …………., n.n = total numbers of years for which monthly groundwater records are used.

41MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.2.4.3  Stream-Flow Drought Index (SFDI)
The amount of water flows in streams and rivers can provide valuable insights on hydrological 
drought. The flows in streams display high seasonal variability necessitating estimation of variable 
truncation levels for all twelve months in a year. The truncation level is an analytical interpretation 
of expected availability of water flow in a river (refer Table 3.8). The truncation level is defined as 
75% dependable flow (discharge) at a given time and for a given site over a month long time 
period. Therefore, average monthly flow records are required to be used to derive flow duration 
curves for determination of monthly truncation level. Water flow in a river or stream below the 
truncation level is indicative of a drought like scenario. 
The severity of drought event would be classified using a stream flow drought index (SFDI) 
defined as a function of : 
i. the ra
tio of deficit flow volume to corresponding volume at the truncation levels; and
ii. the r
atio of duration of deficit flow to the maximum expected duration of the independent
stream flow drought event.
Where, V
d  = deficit flow volume, 
VTL = corresponding flow volume expected at TL flow 
de = duration of independent drought event, and 
dm = maximum duration of an independent drought event (=365 days). 
Table 3.8 : Classification of Drought based on Stream Flow Index
Stream Flow Drought Index (SFDI) Drought Severity class 
< 0.01 Weak
0.01 to 0.05 Mild
0.05 to 0.2 Moderate
0.2 to 0.5 Severe
Stream flow records (Average 10- daily or monthly discharge data) are maintained by CWC 
which can be sourced by the States for assessment of drought. The SFDI is straightaway applicable 
for the river systems having perennial flow characteristics. In case of intermittent and ephemeral flow characteristics, joint probability distribution approach is required to be used for estimation of truncation level. The SFDI suffers from limitation arising from the non-availability of historical data (30 years or more) which may sometimes result in erroneous assessment of stream-flow drought characteristics, particularly with regard to non snowfed river systems. 
42MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.2.5  Other Factors 
The State Governments may further monitor socio-economic indicators such as the following factors 
 in making a holistic evaluation of drought:-
y Extent of fodder availability and its prevailing prices compared to normal prices and information 
        on cattle camps (see Forms 5 and 6, Annexure-I);
 y Scarcit
y of drinking water supply (human and  livestock) (see Forms 7 and 8, Annexure-1);
 y Demand for emplo
yment on public works, and unusual outmigration of labour in search of 
employment (see Form 9, Annexure-1);
 y Curr
ent agricultural and non-agricultural wages compared with normal times (see Form 9, 
Annexure-1);
 y Supply of food grains, and price situation of essential commodities (see Form 10,     Annexure-1).
These socio-economic indicators may aid State Governments in fine tuning the assessment 
of drought. However, State Governments will need to set up credible data bases and monitoring 
systems for objective evaluation of distress migration, price trends of fodder and food commodities, availability of drinking water etc. 
3.2.6  Ground Truthing or Verification
It is acknowledged by experts that parameters identified for assessment of drought while useful, 
suffer f rom de ficiencies on  account of limitations of the available technology, unavailability of a wide 
network of monitoring stations, paucity and unreliability of long term data.  It is, therefore, essential 
for a realistic and credible determination of a complex phenomenon such as drought, that the 
matrix based analysis (as at Table 3.1 0) is supplemented in the event that values in the matrix 
indicate a ‘Moderate’ or ‘Severe’ drought, by a quick field level sample survey. The findings of the 
quick sample survey shall be conclusive in the determination, intensity and spatial extent of 
drought. The Ground  Truthing (GT) needs to be conducted in each of the 10% of the drought affected  
villages, selected on a random basis. In each of the selected villages, representative locations (about 
5 sites for each of the major crops), may be inspected for data collection.   The GT shall preferably be conducted using a smart phone based App.  The app shall record the GPS coordinates of the site and the photo of the state of crop, with the provision to upload these parameters on a computer server for archiving for post-facto analysis. Inspection of isolated and small fields (<1 acre) should be avoided to improve the quality of field data. The States may identify the relevant crop/field attribute data for the Mobile App.  Appropriate inspection protocols may be developed for providing guidance in collection of data.  An estimation of crop damage / loss of 33% or more on the basis of field verification will qualify for the declaration of drought.  However, for the drought to qualify as one of a ‘severe’ nature, the estimation of damage / loss to crops should be more than 50%. Form-11 at Annexure-1 has been suggested for the compilation of village wise data on damage to sown crops. 
It is desirable that declaration of drought by the State Governments is supported by the matrix 
based analysis and field level verification / GT. 
43MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.3  process for the determin Ation of drought 
The Drought Monitoring Cells (DMCs) in the States will monitor data regularly on various critical 
paramet
ers referred to earlier in this chapter and apprise the SEC/Disaster Management Department 
in the State Government on the spread and intensity of an emerging drought like situation. As 
ref
erred to earlier, the complexity of drought cannot be captured with the aid of a single indicator, 
but require a more comprehensive understanding of data on several parameters read in conjunction 
with rainfall, the most important and mandatory parameter in any determination of drought 
and bolstered by a field verification.  Table 3.10 sub para 3.3.1 below provides a simple matrix to 
help make an objective assessment of drought. 
3.3.1  Steps in the Determination of Drought
Following steps are suggested for the determination of drought: 
Step 1:  Mandatory Indicators viz. RF deviation or SPI or Dry Spell will be considered as per matrix at 
Table 3.9 to assess if the first drought trigger is set off. 
Table 3.9:  Matrix for rainfall deviations and dry spells (Trigger-1)
Rf Dev/SPI Dry spell Drought trigger
Deficit or scanty rf/SPI<-1 Yes Yes
Deficit or scanty rf/SPI<-1 No Yes if rainfall is scanty or SP<-1.5, else No
Normal rf/SPI>-1 Yes Yes
Normal rf/SPI>-1 No No
Step 2:  In the event that the first drought trigger is set off in Step 1, the Impact Indicators will 
be examined as per the matrix at Table 3.10.

The States may consider any three of the four types of the Impact Indicators (one from each) for  
assessment of drought, the intensity of the calamity and make a judgement. 
44MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Explanation :
The intensity of the drought will be contingent upon the values of at least three out of four 
Impact Indicators viz, Agriculture, Remote Sensing, Soil Moisture and Hydrology in the following 
manner: 
 y Severe drought:   if  all the selected 3 impact indicators are in Severe category  
 y Moderate drought:  if two of the selected 3 impact indicators are in  ‘Moderate’ or ‘Severe’ class. 
 y Normal:  for all other cases. 
 y Trigger 2 will be set off in the event of a finding of ‘severe’ or ‘moderate’ drought. 
 y The State has an option to reduce the drought category by one rank (i.e. Severe to Moderate) if the irrigation percentage of the administrative region (District/Taluk/Block/Mandal), for which drought is being declared is more than 75%. However, in such a situation of reduction of drought intensity from ‘Moderate’ to ‘Normal’ , the State Government will still be required to conduct field verification as prescribed in Step 3 below.  
Step 3:  In the event that trigger 2 is set off, States will conduct sample survey for ground truthing as described at 3.2.6 above and in order to make a final determination of drought.  The finding of field verification exercise will be the final basis for judging the intensity of drought as ‘severe’ or ‘moderate’ .
45MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.4  declArAtion of drought
The State Governments will declare drought through a notification specifying clearly the 
geographical extent and administrative units such as Gram Panchayats, Blocks, Mandals, Taluks, Sub-
division, Districts. Such notification will also indicate the level of severity of the drought (moderate or severe).  The validity of such notification will not be for more than 6 months unless de-notified earlier.  The declaration of Kharif drought should not be done later than 30 October and the Rabi drought by 31 March. The State Governments will declare the calamity as “drought ” and not by any other nomenclature, if the conditions referred to in 3.3.1 are fulfilled (see Annexure-3).
Drought declaration in the early season
Drought declaration during August month may be carried-out, if the seasonal conditions signify 
drought like situation. Deficit rainfall in June and July with prolonged dry spells leading to significant 
reduction in crop sown area can trigger the declaration of early drought.
Indicators for early season drought declaration
Rainfall deficiency based on rainfall deviation or SPI and the dry spell as shown in Table 3.9 
continue to be mandatory for declaration.
Among the impact indicators, reduction in crop sown area or failed sowing, MAI, Ground water 
or Reservoir water index are important. NDVI is less effective when the canopy coverage is low. In 
such situation NDWI, a surface wetness indicator is preferred to NDVI.
3.5  memor Andum for fin AnciAl Assist Ance
3.5.1  Submission of Memorandum for Financial assistance under NDRF
A Memorandum for assistance under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) will be 
submitted within a week of the declaration of drought only if the calamity is of a severe nature.  
Only those items should be included in the Memorandum that are admissible as per extant guidelines 
of the Ministry of Home Affairs.   The Memorandum for assistance will mandatorily contain a copy 
of the State Government notification on drought, details of assessment of drought as per Table 3.10 
and details of village-wise field verification data (see Annexure-4). The State Governments will 
consider the overall socio-economic scenario as reflected through distress migration, fodder 
shortage, food and drinking water scarcities, abnormal price rise in food commodities and 
fodder, malnutrition among vulnerable sections for providing relief. 
46MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
3.6  timelines
States will notify Kharif drought by 30 October and the Rabi drought by 31 March.  The 
memorandum for assistance will be submitted to the DAC&FW within a week of the declaration, in 
case the drought is of serious nature.
The DAC&FW will constitute and dispatch an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) to the drought 
affected area within a week of receipt of the Memorandum from the State Government.  The IMCT will submit a report for the consideration of the Central Government within 7 days of all relevant information provided by the State Government following the visit to the drought affected areas.  The Central Government will take a final decision on the assistance to the State from the NDRF within a month of the receipt of the IMCT Report. 
The State Governments will ensure disbursement of agriculture input subsidy to affected farmers 
within one month from the date of receipt of Central assistance from the NDRF.  The timelines in the case of declaration of an early season drought will be suitable modified for the different activities enumerated above. Various instruments of Direct Benefit Transfer to beneficiaries will be employed to ensure efficiency and transparency in the process of fund transfer.  
3.7   direct benefit trAnsfer (dbt)
Direct Benefit Transfer is a major reform initiative launched by Government of India to re-engineer 
the existing cumbersome delivery processes using modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This programme aims to transfer benefits directly into the bank/postal accounts, preferably Aadhaar seeded, of accurately targeted beneficiaries. In a nutshell, DBT intends to achieve:
a)  Electronic transfer of benefits, minimising levels involved in benefit flow
b)  Reduced delay in payments
c)  Accurate targeting of the beneficiary
d)  Curbing pilferage and duplication
DBT is an attempt to ensure a better and more timely delivery of benefits directly into the hands 
of the beneficiaries, speeding up payments, removing leakages, and enhancing financial inclusion. 
State Governments should invariably use DBT to provide various kinds of beneficiary oriented 
assistance under SDRF/NDRF like gratuitous relief, assistance to farmers for land/crop loss, assistance 
to small and marginal farmers for replacement of animals, assistance to fishermen, assistance to handicraft/handloom artisans and assistance for houses damaged etc.
The list of beneficiaries will be published in the website of the District Collector and the State 
Government for general information and transparency.

49MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Implementation of drought relief  and response measures are initiated following the declaration 
of drought. Drought being a complex phenomenon, the response and relief measures, often 
require sector-specific planning and immense inter-departmental coordination. It is necessary that these measures are undertaken promptly and in a planned manner for maximum impact in the amelioration of the hardships caused by drought to the farmers and common people. In fact, it is strongly suggested that response measures in line with Crisis Management Plan and District Crop Contingency Plans ought to get activated as soon as the distress signs become visible, without waiting for a formal declaration of drought. However, such measures related to drought relief e.g., remission of land revenue and other taxes and dues, deferment and restricting of crop loans, agricultural input subsidy etc, can only be set in motion with the formal declaration of drought by the State Government.  The success and sustainability of these measures depend on a continuous exchange of information between the village-levels and the decision-making levels in the State, a responsive administrative structure and careful planning. 
This section discusses sector-specific drought relief and response, identifying lead
 and support 
agencies and detailing the measures that need to be taken. It also includes  a section on institutional 
response and financing relief expenditure. A checklist for the Relief Commissioners and District Collectors has been provided at the end of this chapter.
Crisis Management Plan
The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare prepares a Crisis Management Plan for drought 
(CMP) before the commencement of each Kharif season. The CMP provides a crisis management framework to identify phases of the crisis and the strategic response corresponding to each such phase. The plan also provides for a Strategic Activity Planner to act as a ready reckoner for critical steps that need to be taken in different times of the year with respect to drought preparedness, drought reporting and drought response, and the agencies responsible for the identified activities. Central Ministries and State Governments may seek guidance from the CMP to devise their own management plans for drought. 
Drought Contingency Planning
District Agriculture Contingency Plans (DACPs) have been formulated for more than 600 
agriculturally important districts in the country so far by the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare to suggest contingency strategies to farmers to cope with major weather related aberrations, including delay in onset of south-west monsoon, dry spells etc. CRIDA has prepared these extensive district plans covering crops, horticulture, livestock, poultry and fisheries sectors in consultation with State Agricultural Universities and State Government departments (www.crida.in;http://agricoop.nic.in). The State Governments are expected to have contingency plans prepared for drought management at sub-district levels (tehsil/block/mandal/taluka).

Lead Agencies: State relief and disaster management department, State departments of 
Agriculture, Horticulture, Irrigation, Watershed management, State Seed Corporations, State electricity boards, commercial and cooperative banks.
Support Agencies: Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, (Government of India), Indian 
Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), IMD, MNCFC, Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, State Agricultural Universities, State Remote Sensing Centres etc. 
Objectives: The objective of a contingency plan is to provide cropping and other options to 
the farmers to help them withstand drought conditions. The recommended measures include 
alternate crop varieties / alternate crops suitable in the event of a delay in onset of monsoon rains or dry spell; management options tailored for initial / mid-season / end of season drought scenarios in rainfed  / groundwater irrigated / tankfed areas/ canal command areas, both for field and horticultural crops.
The DACP recommends contingency measures to cope with drought for rainfed and irrigated 
(groundwater irrigated, tankfed and canal command areas) farming situations on account of delayed onset of monsoon (2/4/6/8 weeks delay) and (early/midseason/terminal drought) for field and horticulture crops. The contingency measures include alternate crops /crop varieties/ agronomic practices/other management options appropriate for drought scenarios. 
The DACP should be updated from time to time to incorporate inputs related to new technological 
advancements and field experiences from scientific institutions (ICAR/SAUs), Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare and other related departments of Central and State Governments, such as Water Resources / Irrigation, Animal Husbandry, Rural Development, Drinking Water, Banking, etc, State line departments and other stakeholders. There is a need to consider the impact of climate change, the advantages to farmers from the adoption of new moisture stress tolerant crop varieties, water saving innovations, etc. while updating the plans. 
Preparedness
Careful advance preparation is critical to an effective response and containment of drought.  The 
ambit of preparedness should extend to the following: 
 y Establishment of a functional DMC at the State Headquarters.
 y Preparation of Agriculture Contingency Plans for districts and sub-district levels, especially in vulnerable districts.
 y Identification of drought prone areas, preferably at the sub district level.

 y The contingency plans are to be operationalized  based on assessment of type of drought. 
 y Choice of short duration and less water-intensive crops, unlike paddy and sugarcane, which 
consume a lot of water . Alternate crops such as maize, pulses, groundnut, sunflower , soybean, fodder and millets can be considered.
 y Advocacy for crop diversification, mixed / inter-cropping of main crop with drought tolerant companion crops, thinning of plant population, weed management, mulching for soil moisture conservation, supplementary / protective irrigation particularly with drip / sprinkler systems.
 y Contingency plan during the kharif season is usually constrained by uncertainty of weather behaviour; and lack of lead-time causing logistical problems in organizing delivery of agricultural
 
inputs. There is a need to utilize information on the pattern of spatial and temporal variation of monsoon to improve the efficacy of contingency crop plans.
 y It is necessary that the decision-makers get information on the likely monsoon behaviour even earlier than July to put contingency measures in place. While there are certain risks and uncertainties to respond to anomalous weather conditions in July, the confidence level for crop planning increases during pre-rabi and more certainly during rabi seasons. Better information on the extent of soil moisture, reservoir water and ground water levels can help the State Governments in issuing advisories for crop planning.
4.1.1.  Near Real-Time Implementation of Contingency Plans
Implementation
While some of the preparedness measures such as management practices particularly in-situ soil 
conservation, tank silt application, conservation tillage, conservation agriculture measures help in overcoming dry spells, a scenario may still arise on account of long dry spells or sensitiveness of crop which may warrant intervention by line departments. 
The real-time contingency measures aim to (i) establish a crop with optimum plant population 
during the delayed onset of monsoon; (ii) ensure better performance of crops during seasonal drought (early/mid and terminal drought) and extreme events, enhance performance, improve productivity and income; (iii) minimize damage to horticultural crops/produce; (iv) minimize physical damage to livestock, poultry and fisheries sector and ensure better  performance to ensure food security at village level and (v) enhance the adaptive capacity and livelihoods of the farmers.
The States are required to prepare agro-advisory bulletins in response to weather forecasts in 
consultation with State agricultural / horticulture / veterinary Universities and other NARS partners for the use of farmers. 
States are advised to install, collect, analyze and utilize the rainfall information from sub district 
levels i.e., Tehsils / blocks / mandals etc. in order to address the issues of drought realistically.
To ensure successful implementation of DACPs, following support systems need to be put in 
place.
  The States are advised to prepare agro-advisory bulletins based on crop contingency 
plans and widely
 disseminate them among farmers in drought-affected region. The district agro-
54MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
advisory bulletins issued by IMD (www.imdagrimet.gov.in; www.farmer.gov.in; www.mkisan.gov.in) 
under Gramin Krishi Mausam Seva project may also be consulted while preparing their agro-advisory 
bulletins. 
Some of the methods/measures to be adopted as near real-time contingency plan implementation 
during various weather aberrations are given in some near-real time methods/measures to be adopted to cope with delayed onset of monsoon and seasonal drought  are described below.
Delayed onset of monsoon
In rainfed areas, as a general rule early sowing of crops with the onset of monsoon is the best-
bet practice that gives higher realizable yield. Major crops affected due to monsoon delays are those crops that have a narrow sowing window and therefore cannot be taken up if the delay is beyond this cut-off date. Crops with wider sowing windows can still be taken up till the cut-off date without major yield loss and only the change warranted could be the choice of short duration cultivars. Beyond the sowing window, choice of alternate crops or cultivars depends on the farming situation, soil, rainfall and cropping pattern in the location and extent of delay in the onset of monsoon.
Early season drought
Early season drought may at times result in seedling mortality needing re-sowing or may result 
in poor crop stand and seedling growth. Further, the duration of water availability for crop growth gets reduced due to the delayed start, and the crops suffer from an acute shortage of water during reproductive stage due to early withdrawal of monsoon. The effect of early season drought is less on the crop, because during this period sowing is carried out. Various operations carried out are primary tillage, sowing, fertilizer application and intercultural operations. Other agronomic measures include resowing within a week to 10 days with subsequent rains for better plant stand when germination is less than 30%, thinning in small-seeded crops, interculture to break soil crust and remove weeds and create soil mulch for conserving soil moisture, avoiding top dressing of fertilizers till favourable soil moisture, opening conservation furrows at 10 to 15 m intervals, ridge and furrow across the slope for effective moisture conservation as well as in rainwater in wide spaced crops (>30 cm), pot watering may be taken up along with gap filling when the crop stand is less than 75% in crops like cotton, foliar spray of 2% urea during prolonged dry spells wherever ground/ surface water is available.
Mid-season drought
Stunted growth takes place if mid-season drought occurs at vegetative phase. If it occurs at 
flowering or early reproductive stage, it will have an adverse effect on the ultimate crop yield. In-situ soil-moisture conservation is a vital component of dryland crop management practices. During mid season drought plant protection, top-dressing of fertilizer, intercultural and supplemental irrigation are the usual practices. In case of long dry spells, crop based production system (location) related specific contingency plans are needed. Other agronomic measures include repeated interculture to remove weeds and create soil mulch to conserve soil moisture, thinning, avoiding top-dressing of fertilizers until receipt of rains, opening conservation furrows for moisture conservation, foliar spray of 2% KNO
3 or 2% urea solution or 1% water soluble fertilizers like 19-19-19, 20-20-20, 21-21-21 to 
supplement nutrition during dry spells, open alternate furrows, surface mulching with crop residues, providing supplemental irrigation (10 cm depth), if available.
55MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Terminal drought
If there is a terminal drought, crop-management strategies like plant protection, soil and water 
conservation, interculture, supplemental irrigation and harvesting are to be adopted. Terminal 
droughts are more critical as the grain yield is strongly related to water availability during the reproductive stage. Further, these conditions are often associated with an increase in ambient temperatures leading to forced maturity. The agronomic measure include providing life- saving or supplemental irrigation, if available, from harvested pond water or other sources, harvesting crop at physiological maturity with some realizable yield or harvest for fodder and prepare for winter (rabi) sowing in double- cropped areas. Ratoon maize or pearl millet or adopt relay crops as chickpea, safflower, rabi sorghum and sunflower with minimum tillage after soybean in medium to deep black 
soils in Maharashtra or take up contingency crops (horsegram/cowpea) or dual-purpose forage crops on receipt of showers under receding soil moisture conditions.
4.1.2. Implementation of DACPs
The implementation of DACPs would require the following support systems.
Seed Banks 
During drought, the availability of seeds of appropriate varieties in sufficient quantities is a major 
challenge. 
To ensure availability of the desired seed at the time of drought, a plan for production or sourcing 
of desirable seed varieties needs to be implemented well in advance. A Consortium Approach for production, supply and timely availability of the seed to the farmers is advocated with sufficient guarantees from the State Government for procurement of the available contingent seed. Seed Banks can be set up at the most strategically advantageous locations for which adequate financial provisions will be called for. 
Fodder Banks 
Livestock component is critical for ensuring livelihoods particularly in arid regions during 
drought years. Fodder Banks need to be established at strategic locations using improved fodder/feed storage methods for supply of fodder to deficit areas. Community lands may be identified for fodder production. 
Nutrient Banks  
The concept of Nutrient Bank is being evolved wherein stocks of essential manures and fertilizers, 
soil amendments, foliar spray chemicals; bio-fertilizers etc. are maintained locally and made available to the local community to help timely sowing even when the sowing window is limited. These nutrient banks can be managed by SHGs in conjunction with Gram Panchayats. Farmers can approach nutrient bank to avail foliar sprays like KNO3 spray, which enhances drought tolerance. 
Custom Hiring Centre (CHC)
Custom hiring centres for farm machinery at village level are likely to enhance availability of 
implements at low cost, to help in zero tillage, improved seed and fertilizer application, in situ 
56MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
moisture conservation practices, water lifting with energy efficient pumps  and efficient application 
(through micro irrigation systems), foliar sprays, harvesting of crops, residue incorporation, relay cropping etc. even to small farmers on a real time contingency basis.
Suppor t  to  Farmers 
Farmers require prompt government support in the form of inputs, credit and extension 
services on a proactive basis. 
 y Agriculture Input Support: Farmers in drought-affected areas need to be provided with subsidized seeds of appropriate varieties to help with the second sowing.
 y Energy Support : Farmers need to be provided assured quality power supply for irrigation. 
 y Extension Support : The State department of agriculture through its various bodies 
including ATMA (Agricultural Technology Management Agency) and agricultural universities should provide extension services related to advice on crop varieties, selection of seeds, soil
 and water conservation measures, contingency crops and agronomic practices. State 
Governments could also use the Kisan Call Centres (KCCs) and M-Kisan portal of DAC&FW for communicating audio/text messages and advisories to farmers. Audio conferencing of experts with the farmers registered with KCCs and M-kisan portal also could be considered. The State Governments could consider training the Farm Tele Advisors of KCCs so as to enable them to render proper advices and suggestions to the farmers in the Drought affected areas.
57MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
relief employment
Objectives: The most important relief component during the drought period is the generation of 
employment. Due to drought, agricultural operations are reduced substantially, restricting the scope for gaining employment. People look for alternative employment, or migrate elsewhere in search of employment. As soon as drought is declared, it is, therefore, necessary for the State Governments to immediately start relief employment programmes and provide work to those who need employment  in the vicinity. Income generation through these employment works helps participating workers to meet their basic needs. 
Lead Agencies: Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, State Government departments of 
rural development, the district administration.
Support Agencies: State Government departments of irrigation /water resources, watershed management, 
forest, public works and water conservation.
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)
Implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural 
Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005 provides the legal framework for 
the flagship programme of the Government that directly touches lives of the poor and promotes inclusive growth. The Act aims at enhancing livelihood security of households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is one of the largest 
and most ambitious social security and public works programmes in the world. The primary objective is augmenting wage employment.   The other main objective is strengthening natural resource management through works that address causes of chronic poverty like drought, deforestation and soil erosion and so encourage sustainable development.  The scheme is a significant step towards strengthening grass-root processes of democracy and infusing transparency and accountability in governance.
The Act came into force on February 2, 2006 and was implemented in a phased manner. In Phase 
I it was introduced in 200 of the most backward districts of the country. It was implemented in an additional 130 districts in Phase II (2007-2008). In Phase III the Act was notified in the remaining rural districts of India from April 1, 2008.

Demand for work
1. Registering demand for work is central to the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. The 
Program Officer and the Programme Implementing Agencies (PIA) must ensure that the process of submission of applications for work must be kept open on a continuous basis. 
2. The implementing agencies must ensure that workers in need of employment under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA are provided work within 15 days of the receipt of the application or the date of demand, in case of advance application, whichever is later, as mandated by the Act. Program Officer and implementing agencies must ensure that work is provided on demand within 15 days.
3. The mandate of the Act is to provide at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult member volunteers to do unskilled manual work. The Ministry mandates the provision of additional 50 days of wage employment (beyond the stipulated 100 days) per Scheduled Tribe Household in a forest area, provided that these households have no other private property except for the land rights provided under the FRA Act 2006. 
4. In exercise of the provisions under Section 3 (4) of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, the Central Government decides to provide an additional 50 days of unskilled manual work in a financial year, over and above the 100 days assured to job card holders in such rural areas where drought or natural calamities (as defined by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India from time to time) have been notified. The notification is issued by the Ministry of Rural Development based on the notification of the State Government to this effect and as recommended by the Department of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers Welfare.
Other Employment Generating Schemes
The State Relief Commissioners need to prepare plans, in consultation with line departments 
responsible for labour-intensive works, for providing relief employment  to the people especially in 
chronically susceptible regions. The Relief Commissioner must prepare a financial plan for meeting the expenditure incurred on relief employment in close coordination with the Rural Development Department and the district administration.
In a drought situation, the volume of demand for rural employment is likely to see a significant 
spike and therefore it is necessary for the State Government to bring about convergence of all schemes and programmes of the Centre and States which have a potential for employment generation, such 
59MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna, Local Area Development Schemes for the Members of 
Parliament (MPLADS) and Members of State Legislature (MLALADS)etc. 
The departments responsible for the implementation of this programme need to start p u b l i c 
works in drought-affected areas to maximize employment. The State Government may take necessary steps to encourage increased workers’ participation in these programmes. 
MPLADS and MLALADS have the potential to generate relief employment. Further , large-scale 
employment can be generated through works like canal excavation etc. 
The State Governments need to issue a detailed set of guidelines and directives to the district 
administration for commencing relief employment programmes. The district administration needs to be given authority and flexibility within the framework of these guidelines for implementing relief employment programmes.
At the district level, Collectors of drought-affected district are required to prepare  district plans 
for relief employment, specifying the types and number of works to be taken in different pockets of the district and the total employment these works would
 generate.
The district administration must provide employment to people as soon as there is a demand 
for employment with minimum delay. While planning, it is necessary that people get employment within 1.5–5 kilometers of their residence.
The Collector should direct all technical departments to identify feasible works (preferably 
as per the needs of the local community) in all the drought-affected villages and prepare estimates for these works and provide technical sanction to these works. The Collector should prepare such a plan in consultation with all the technical departments and provide administrative and financial
 approval for all the works included in the plan.
The district administration needs to maintain an extensive shelf of projects for execution in a 
drought situation. All line departments need to be in readiness for starting these works. They need to reassign their staff and keep the equipments in readiness for starting these works. Where tools and equipment are not adequate for starting these works, the line departments need to procure them, with a defined responsibility for their safe storage.
The Collector must conduct regular meetings of all the technical departments responsible for 
implementing relief employment programmes. The works in progress, attendance on these works, administrative and technical issues, wage payment and release of food grains to the workers are issues that need to be reviewed in these meetings.
The Collectors should be authorized to redeploy technical and administrative staff within the 
district for implementing and supervising these works in consultation with regional heads of these departments. In such instances, where the relief works have started on a large-scale, the Collectors can request the State Government to post additional officers on a temporary basis. Collectors can be authorized to hire vehicles,
 provide daily allowance and get administrative support 
for facilitating the implementation and supervision of relief works. The Collectors need to invoke disciplinary powers for proceeding against officers found to be in dereliction of their duties.
In the course of implementing relief employment programmes, priority needs to be given to 
water conservation, water harvesting works (such as check dams, gabion structures, percolation tanks), 
60MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
and minor irrigation works (such as tanks and farm ponds, canal  excavation, community wells, nalla 
bunding, afforestation). These works are useful for enhancing the availability of water and agricultural 
production. Desilting and cleaning  of canals, which is overdue on account of non-availability of 
resources for many years, is also helpful in supplying of water to the tail-end users. For each State, these priorities may change as per the local situation. A discussion on the importance of these individual works for drought mitigation has been provided in the section on drought mitigation.
Along with the public works, it would be useful to undertake individual beneficiary oriented 
works to help as it create durable assets and enhance sources of income. These include:
 y Farm ponds / percolation tanks
 y New wells / deepening of wells / recharging of wells
 y Horticulture / agro-forestry
 y Construction of new water channels / rain harvesting structures
 y Sanitation latrines
The State Government should lay down the criteria for the selection of beneficiaries for taking up 
these individual beneficiary works. While sanctioning these works, technical and financial norms need to be fixed. For the payment of wages, the muster roll must be maintained.
In the tribal and hilly areas, the local conditions may not be conducive for large-
 scale 
employment. In such a situation, individual beneficiary works for tribals should  be taken up. It 
should involve land development, plantations and afforestation, water conservation programmes, grass cutting and storage, construction of new farm ponds and wells and rural houses.
It is necessary that spill-over works taken in the previous years as drought relief
 works be taken 
up first. Works that can be completed or brought to a safe stage, can be next on the priority list. New works can be taken only where the spill-over plan works are not available. Only after these works are completed, should new works be taken up. A new work can be taken up for execution only after all preliminary steps, such as preparation of plans and estimates and technical sanction and administrative approval
 of the appropriate authority, are completed.
Collectors must report to the State Government of the number of works, the total  attendance of 
workers, the total wages paid and the distribution of foodgrains on a weekly basis.
In the drought-affected areas, Gram Sabhas need to be convened in all the Gram Panchayats 
for discussing the drought situation. In the Gram Sabha, water use management, relief employment works, payment of wages, and provision of foodgrains need to be on the agenda for deliberations. Gram Sabhas can become an effective forum for conducting a social audit of drought relief operations and need to be held
 once a month.
While the district administration must strive to provide employment to all the able-bodied 
adult, men and women and there cannot be any discrimination in the provision of relief, special attention needs to be focused on “below poverty line” families, landless labourers, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe households. 
61MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Each worker should be issued a job card, which would help in closely monitoring the attendance 
on works, payment of wages and amount of foodgrains to each worker. The job card should be 
available to the Inspecting Officers at work sites. Under the MGNREGA, all participating families are given job cards. These job cards need to be extended to other relief employment programmes also.
Wages must be paid to the workers in accordance with the norms laid down for the MGNREGS 
guidelines.  
Information on the number of people provided with relief employment under each scheme 
should be provided in the form prescribed for individual schemes such as the M G NREGS. However, inf orma tion on the demand and supply of the wage employment and migration etc. can be submitted in Form No. 9 included in the Annexure 1.
62MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
wAter resources mAnAgement
Objectives: Water resource management in the drought-affected areas is one of the most critical tasks of 
relief operations. Since water is a basic need for human and cattle population, assured supply of drinking water is the most important responsibility for the Government at all levels. It requires diverse measures such as augmentation of water supply, rationing of water use, and efficient utilization and management of water resources, in both urban and rural areas. Provision of water and its use is the most important yardstick for judging the effectiveness of relief operations. Water scarcity is expected to manifest during events of hydrological drought. Successive years of hydrological drought will enhance the scarcity. 
To assess sector-wise demand and availability of water resources, possible shortages in meeting the 
demand and evolving strategy to work on the shortages, if any. 
Lead Agencies: State Government departments of water supply, Irrigation, rural development, public 
health engineering, and relief, as well as the district administration.
Support Agencies: Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Water Resources, RD &GR; 
Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India; Central Water Commission, Central Ground Water Board, Railways, State Government groundwater survey and development agency, Irrigation, Drinking water and watershed development departments.
Storage levels of water in surface water bodies and in ground water reservoirs and aquifers tend 
to get impacted in the event of hydrological drought and as such areas with high rainfall may not 
be immune to severe scarcity of water. Shortage of water is one of the earliest indicators of drought and therefore, a realistic assessment of demand for water, its total availability and management of supply is extremely important in the management of drought.
Provision of  Water
The first step in water resource management is estimation of the availability and demand 
for water from the Gram Panchayat upto the district level on the basis of the consumption needs for drinking, agriculture, industry etc. All follow up measures aimed at conservation, augmentation and sector-wise prioritization of water supply emerges from an accurate estimation of demand and availability. 
Following measures are proposed for managing the water resources in a drought-affected 
area:
Reservoir Management
 y The State Government is advised to enunciate the policy for laying down the priorities for use of reservoir storage for drinking, irrigation, industry, power plants, recreation, and other commercial uses. 
63MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y In keeping with the State policy, in a drought situation, it is the Collector who undertakes reservoir 
management with the help and support of the irrigation / water resources department and Zilla Panchayat.  The irrigation / water resources department and / or Zilla Panchayat provide relevant information to  the  Collector  in  respect  to  storage  of  water  in  reservoirs  and  enforce  his instructions regarding its distribution and use. The Collector must determine the quantity of water that is required to be reserved for drinking water purposes, and intimate the same to the concerned water supply / irrigation authorities. The Collector’ s order for water reservation for the purpose of drinking should be binding upon the water supply /irrigation authorities. Appropriate decision on the allocation of quantities and timing of release of the balance water for other purposes will be taken by the Collector. 
 y Water required to be supplied to a village or town for the purpose of drinking water should, as far as possible, be taken from the reservoir and conveyed to the village or town through a pipeline. Only in exceptional circumstances, such as where the village or town is situated within a short distance from the reservoir , the water could be released in the river.
 y In case situation demands, the domestic water supply needs to be arranged through transportation by road or railway.
Repairs and Augmentation of Existing Water Supply Schemes
 y The State Government should issue special orders for repairs of pipelines, electric-pumps, hand-pumps dug wells etc, and augmentation of all existing water supply schemes well before the monsoon season. 
 y Departments of water supply, public health engineering and rural development and Panchayat Raj will cooperate with the Collector in carrying out repair and augmentation work of drinking water supply schemes and provide all necessary information regarding water supply. 
 y The Collector needs to prepare a T aluka-wise list of all the water supply schemes in the district which need repairs. The Collector can accordingly prepare a contingency plan, in consultation with the technical agencies and local bodies, on the basis of availability of mechanical supervisors, mechanics and electricians and inventory of spare parts and accessories. Mobile vans with hand pump mechanics carrying spare parts, tools and tackles may be deployed in the Gram Panchayats to ensure on the spot repair of reported hand pumps and restoration without unnecessary delay. In those cases, where technically qualified people are not available with the Government agencies, they could be employed on a contractual basis at the Taluka or village level. While preparing such contingency plans, special attention should be paid to susceptible areas in the district. 
 y At the village level, it should be the duty of the Sarpanch or Gram Sevak, or any other functionary appointed for this purpose, to promptly report to the T ehsildar
 and Block Development Officer 
when any hand pump or power pump goes out of order. The T ehsildar and Block Development Officer , with the assistance of engineers of the relevant departments, should ensure that the hand pump or the electrical
 pump fitted on a bore-well is immediately repaired with the 
assistance of the line department. In many cases where the repairs needed are major , a mobile repairs unit can be sent for carrying out the necessary repairs.
 y When drought is declared, a district-level campaign should be organized for repairing all the hand pumps and electricity /  pumps fitted on bore-wells. The campaign would be more effective if it is supported by indenting in spare parts and accessories required for carrying out 
64MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
necessary repairs in advance. For each hand pump and bore-well, a card can be maintained 
which records the visits of mechanics and electricians and the details of repairs that have been carried out.
 y The village Panchayat has the overall responsibility for proper maintenance and timely repairs of the piped water supply. However, in a drought situation, village Panchayats can be given suitable grants by the district administration for meeting the expenditure on maintenance and repairs of the water supplies.
 y The Collector should be provided funds for immediate repairs to water supply
 schemes, hand 
pumps, solar pumps and bore-wells through the SDRF/departmental schemes. These funds can be placed with the technical agencies for undertaking necessary repairs to these water supply schemes.
 y The drinking water bore wells / tube wells need to be assessed periodically for their aquifer efficiency, well efficiency, conveyance and distribution efficiency.
 y Water conservation measures to be taken up on top priority. In case of successive droughts, the ground water resources should be assessed and considered for exclusive use in the supply of drinking water. In such circumstances, the closing of sluice gates of minors / major irrigation tanks and conservation of water for human and livestock consumption ought to be given priority.
Special Measures and Schemes for Areas with Drinking Water Scarcity
 y With the earliest signs of a hydrological drought, the Collector should direct the T ehsildars and Block Development Officers to visit the affected areas and draw up T aluka-wise lists of villages in which drinking water scarcity has already developed, or likely to arise. Such visits will always be undertaken with the engineers and officials of water supply, public health engineering, or rural development department, as the case may be. Such lists should be developed with maps indicating the location of villages,
 routes linking these villages and existing sources of water 
supply in these villages,  such as piped water supply, bore-wells, or dug wells.
 y The Collector would get the list of these problem villages counterchecked through the Sub-Divisional Officers and other district officers from the relevant departments. The Collector should also personally visit 5–10% of the villages for verifying the factual position related to availability of drinking water. The Collector should then finalize the list in consultation with the officials dealing with water supply and the State ground water survey and development agency.
 y On the basis of this information, the Collector should prepare a contingency plan
 for provision 
of drinking water in all the villages that are likely to face a water scarcity. The contingency plan should lay down the priority for provision of drinking water as follows:
 y Any piped water supply scheme, which is already under execution in any of these villages, should be completed expeditiously;
 y Piped water supply, temporary piped water supply, or bore-wells already constructed in any of the villages which are non-functional should be made functional by undertaking necessary repairs or renovation;
 y The maintenance work of hand pumps or electrical pumps fitted on bore-wells in the village should be completed on top priority. If an existing bore-well can provide enough water to the village by installation of a power pump, then the district administration should take emergent 
65MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
measures to get the power pump installed;
 y The feasibility of a new bore-well in the village should be assessed with the help of State ground 
water survey and development agency. Where feasible, a programme installing new bore-wells could be taken up. Care should be taken to avoid deep bore-wells as they damage aquifers.
 y If any of the above mentioned measures are not feasible, emergent measures such as desilting, deepening, or blasting of existing wells, or construction of open wells
 in river beds can be 
undertaken, as suggested in the section on Other Emergency Measures for Supply of Drinking Water.
 y If the district administration assesses that these sources of water would not be sufficient to meet the drinking water needs of a village, they can arrange to provide drinking water through tankers or bullock carts, as suggested in the section on Supply of Water through T ankers and Bullock Carts.
Construction of T emporary Piped Water Supply
 y The State Government should decide to construct temporary piped water supply  in a village, if 
the following conditions are fulfilled:
  No source of drinking water supply is available or is likely to be available  within a distance 
of 0.5 kilometre of the village;
  No possibility of constructing a new bore-well at the village or within a distance of one kilometre of the village or to undertake further drilling in the existing bore-well at the village, due to non-availability of groundwater source at the village;
  Where, water supply at the rate of 40 litres per day per head would be available at the source for the projected human and livestock population of the village;
  Where the supply is based on a private source of water , e.g. a private well, it is ensured that the source is adequate to last till the scarcity abates;
 y The Collector should fix the agency for commissioning temporary water supply in consultation with the department of water supply, public health engineering, or rural development department, as the case may be. It could either be implemented
 by the agency responsible for 
water supply in the State or a local body.
 y Each State Government should delegate powers of technical and administrative approval of the temporary water supply schemes to authorities.
Construction of Bore-wells
 y A bore-well programme can be taken up in a village, which is facing or is likely to face drinking water scarcity, if it is technically feasible to construct bore-wells at such a village. Sites for bore-wells can be selected on the basis of recommendations made by the State ground water survey and development agency.
 y Bore-wells with a hand pump fitted thereon can be set up for a population of 250. 
 y If the population exceeds 250, more than one bore-well can be installed to serve the village.
 y The Collector can request the departments of water supply, public health
 engineering, or 
rural development department, as the case may be, to deploy  drilling machines for installing 
66MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
bore-wells. Where it is necessary to obtain additional  drilling machines, these can be obtained on 
hire from private owners.
 y When a village has power supply, for a population of at least 500 one or more bore- wells having 
high yield power pumps may be installed only on one such bore-well  for solving the problem of 
drinking water in the village.
 y When a bore-well programme is undertaken in a village, it is necessary to take into account the cattle population of the village. Along with bore-wells, it would be necessary to provide water taps and troughs for the cattle.
Other Emergency Measures for Supply of Drinking Water
 y The Collector should undertake emergency measures such as de-silting or deepening of existing public wells to increase the availability of water. Other measures such as in-well drilling, blasting and revitalization can also be attempted for augmenting the capacity of these wells. These measures need to be planned
 with the support of departments of water supply, 
public health engineering, or rural development department, as the case may be,
 y Where no public well is available or is likely to be successful after taking such measures, the Collector may authorize and make available a private well on rent, if the owner of the well agrees to allow public consumption with no discrimination against any caste, creed or religion. In all the cases where a private well is being brought under use, the Collector should fix the rent for drawing drinking water and make the payment to the owner of the well and also make an announcement to this effect so that the owners of private wells come forward to offer their wells for supply of drinking water at a rent fixed by the district administration.
 y Old wells that have fallen into disuse should be repaired for ensuring drinking water supply to the villagers if the State ground water survey and development agency certifies that after carrying out the necessary repairs the well would provide adequate water supply. Before these old wells are used for drawing drinking water, it should be ensured that water is properly chlorinated, and a certificate obtained from the State health department stating that the water is fit for human consumption.
 y Where the water in a river or stream gets scarce, holes could be dug in the beds of the stream or river. Where water has been impounded by putting a temporary bund, such holes could preferably be dug on the banks near the impounded water and the water is reserved in those holes for drinking purposes. This would provide practically filtered water to the villagers for the purpose of drinking.
 y Where the water has sunk much below the bed, it may be necessary to sink concrete pipes in the holes dug in the bed so that water gets collected in the pipes and could then be used for drinking water purposes.
 y When a certain area faces acute drinking water scarcity, it may become necessary to save and preserve water, particularly from small and shallow tanks, for drinking water purposes by controlling evaporation losses. Certain chemicals can be spread over surfaces of water storages, which would control evaporation. However , such a measure needs to be undertaken in consultation with the State health department. The district administration would be responsible for ensuring that chemicals used for controlling evaporation are safe and would not cause any health hazard to the people consuming such water.
67MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y The details of expenditure on installation, augmentation and repairs to all water supply 
schemes and sources can be provided in Form No. 8, included in Annex 1.
Supply of Water through T ankers and Bullock Carts
 y The Collector should take the decision to supply water through tankers or bullock  carts to a 
village or town in the drought-affected area, where no other source of water supply is available. The Collector should decide after obtaining reports from T aluka / Block-level officials, which are counterchecked by Sub-divisional Officers. In such cases too, the Collector should decide to supply water by a tanker or bullock
 cart, where a permanent or temporary water supply system 
is under repairs, till  the time these repairs are completed.
 y While making the survey of villages for supply of water through tankers or bullock  carts, it 
shall be obligatory for the departments of water supply, public health  engineering or rural 
development department, as the case may be, to provide necessary technical, administrative and logistical help.
 y The State Government should issue orders, authorizing the Collector to requisition Government tankers from all the departments for the supply of drinking water. It would be the responsibility of all the departments to provide tankers along with the services of a driver when the Collector makes a demand.
 y If any of the tankers are in disrepair , it should be the responsibility of the officers of the concerned department to undertake necessary repairs to the tanker before making it available to the Collector.
 y The Collector would first deploy Government tankers for the supply of drinking water .
 y Private tankers can be hired only when Government tankers are not available or inadequate for ensuring uninterrupted supply of drinking water to the affected villages. The Collector should hire these vehicles by inviting tenders and fixing the rate for trips involving different distances. The Collector should issue instructions for the maintenance of logbooks of these vehicles, as payment to the owners of these tankers is to be made on the basis of entries in these logbooks.The operations of these tankers need to be regulated carefully. The Collector should discontinue the deployment of tankers immediately after local sources of water have been recharged or re-developed.
 y Where water supply is being arranged through tankers or bullock carts, the Government should consider providing big storage tanks in villages or towns with a capacity of more than 5,000 litres, so that water wastage is minimized.
 y In villages where roads are not motorable, it may be more convenient and economical to engage bullock carts for supplying water . The Collector should hire local bullock carts for supplying water. In all such cases, the Collector should fix the number of trips to be made by bullock carts and pay per trip to the bullock cart owner.
 y In extra ordinary drought situation the drinking water requirement may also be arranged through Railways.
 y Information on supply of drinking water through tankers and bullock carts can be provided in Form No. 7, included in Annexure 1 .

food security
Lead Agencies: State Government Departments of Food and Civil Supplies and the District 
Administration.  
Support Agencies: Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Food 
Corporation of India, Indian Railways, State Government Departments of Women and Child, and School Education.  
Objective: To ensure provision of adequate food and nutrition to the population in drought 
affected areas.  
Provision of Food
1. For food security of the people, Government is implementing the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) which provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural population and upto 50% of the urban population at the national level for receiving subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the population. Corresponding to the above coverage of the all India level, State/UT-wise coverage was determined by the then Planning Commission.  Coverage for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under the Act has been delinked from poverty estimates and is substantially above the percentage of population living below the poverty line.
2. Main responsibility for implementation of NFSA, which inter alia includes identification of eligible households, issuing ration cards to them, ensuring delivery of foodgrains upto door-steps of fair price shops and its timely distribution to eligible households lies with States/UTs and therefore ensuring food security in the drought-affected areas requires the following actions to be taken by the State/UT department of civil supplies:
 y Special drive should be launched to ensure that no deserving and eligible household is left out of coverage under NFSA.
 y In case ration card has not been issued to some deserving and eligible households, supply of subsidized foodgrains to that household should be started on the basis of some other identity proof prescribed by the State Government, till ration card is issued.
 y  In case, names of some members of eligible households are missing from the ration card, immediate steps must be taken for rectification. 
 y The State Government/UT Admn./Collector of the drought affected area must ensure that Fair Price Shops are distributing foodgrains to the people in the drought-affected areas. There should be necessary vigilance against any diversion of foodgrains or its mis-utilization. 
 y In those places, where Fair Price Shops are not available, new ones for the distribution of foodgrains can be started through self-help groups or cooperatives or even village Panchayats. 
 y In remote and difficult to reach areas, mobile Fair Price Shops can be arranged. The schedule of movement of these mobile shops can be fixed and publicized. 
69MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y Inspection of warehouses and Fair Price Shops should be intensified during the drought period, 
to ensure availability of foodgrains and its effective distribution.
 y The State Government/UT Admn./Collector of the drought affected area should exercise surveillance over prices of essential commodities. If the local prices of foodgrains increase, the Collector should bring it to the notice of the State/UT Government. 
 y Wherever required, the State Government/UT Admn./Collector of the drought affected area should take steps to prevent hoarding of essential commodities, prevent manipulation in prices through creation of artificial scarcities and ensure availability of essential commodities in the market. 
3. State Government/UT Administration should make assessment of requirement of additional foodgrains, if any, over and above the NFSA allocation, to deal with special situation arising due to drought, and request the Government of India for additional allocation, which shall make necessary allocation as per the then prevailing policy.
70MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
nutrition Aspects of food security
The State Government should address the nutritional aspects of food security through schemes 
such as the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and Mid-day Meals. The ICDS is implemented 
for pre-school children, while mid-day meal has been introduced for school-going children.
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
The ICDS scheme was initiated in 1975 to improve the health and nutritional status of children 
in the 0–6 age-group by providing supplementary food and coordinating with State health departments to ensure the delivery of the required health inputs. It also provides food supplements to pregnant and lactating women. The type of food supplements in the ICDS programme varies widely, from ready-to-eat food to the supply of supplements cooked in Aanganwadis.
The ICDS programme is centrally sponsored. The centre bears the cost of maintaining 
the infrastructure, while the State bears the expenditure on the food component. 
In a drought situation, the ICDS can be used as the main instrument for ensuring nutritional 
security among the vulnerable sections, which constitute bulk of beneficiaries under this programme even during‘normal times'. Under this arrangement, ICDS centres / Aanganwadis register additional beneficiaries. 
The Government is seeking the services of self-help groups for providing supplementary 
food to Aanganwadis. During a drought situation, the role of self-help
 groups can be increased for 
monitoring the health and nutritional status of women and children. Wherever it is necessary to open additional Aanganwadis temporarily, the Government should sanction them and provide finances for these Aanganwadis through the relief funds.
Mid-day Meal Programmes
With a view to enhance enrolment, retention and attendance and simultaneously improve 
nutritional levels among children, the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE) was launched as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme on 15
th August 1995 to cover 
children studying in classes I-V of Government, Government aided and Local Body Schools. The scheme has been expanded both in coverage and contents since then.  Now the Scheme covers the children studying in elementary classes (I-VIII) in Government, Government aided, Special Training Centres (STCs) and Madarsas/Maqtabs supported under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).  The name of the scheme has also been changed as “Mid Day Meal Scheme in Schools” .  The scheme also provides for giving mid day meals during summer vacation in drought affected areas.   
Community Kitchens
In drought situations where certain segments of people, such as the old, disabled, and women, 
are extremely distressed, the Collectors should start community kitchens, which could be run by the Government itself or through NGOs. These kitchens should
 be run only during the drought 
situation and need to be closed when the situation improves, either through provision of relief employment or improving the state of agriculture.

grAtuitous Assist Ance
Lead Agency:  Relief and Rehabilitation department of State Government and district administration.
Support Agency: Ministry of Agriculture & FW, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Finance 
(Government of India). 
Objectives : Provision of gratuitous assistance in cash or food to old, disabled and destitute persons 
in drought-affected areas as per SDRF/NDRF norms. The State Government should lay down clear 
and reasonable selection criteria for such beneficiaries. Care should be taken to ensure that only such individuals or families without any source of income, livelihood or social welfare benefits and on the verge of destitution/starvation be selected. 
Survey of Eligible Persons
 y As soon as drought is declared, the Collector should survey the population and prepare a list of people who are eligible for gratuitous assistance as per the selection guidelines laid down by the State Government. 
 y The State Government could consider having list of persons eligible for gratuitous assistance approved by the Gram Sabha.
 y The list of people qualifying for gratuitous assistance would be regularly maintained and made available for inspections.
 y The local district official such as the T ehsildar / Block Development Officer / Circle
 Officer should 
compile a list of all persons identified for the distribution of gratuitous assistance and forward it to the Collector. In certain cases, the district officials can test-check the list.
Distribution of Gratuitous Assistance
 y In situations of acute drought instances may come to light of starvation on account of infirmity, sickness, old age or otherwise, where it may become necessary to organize community kitchens or supply
 cooked food. 
 y In remote areas, the Government may also consider setting up foodgrains bank to support the destitute, infirm, and old on a temporary basis. The Government may also take the help of the Gram Panchayats or NGOs to operate such foodgrains bank. Detailed
 instructions need to 
be issued for setting up and operating foodgrains bank.
 y Collector should take all possible steps to prevent starvation deaths. 
Administration of Gratuitous Relief
 y To the extent possible, disbursement of gratuitous relief should be through DBT making use of Jan Dhan accounts. Only in exceptional circumstances to be recorded in writing should cash disbursement be permitted. Village-level officials would maintain a record of cash disbursement.
72MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y The T ehsildar / Block Development Officer / Circle Officer should submit to the Collector a  
return form on expenditure on  gratuitous relief i n  Form No. 12, included in Annexure 1 .
 y All expenditures incurred on granting gratuitous relief should be debited to the budget head used for natural calamities.
 y The norms / guidelines for relief as applicable under the State Disaster Response Fund(SDRF) / National Disaster Response Fund(NDRF) shall be adopted.

and Banks. 
Support Agency: Finance department of the State GovernmentObjectives : The primary objective of such remission, deferments, restructuring, concessions 
and waivers is to help the affected population to tide over the immediate difficulties. 
 y Each State Government may take decisions on remissions, waivers, deferments, loan restructuring, 
concessions etc, taking into account the fiscal situation of the State and severity of the drought. Following steps can be considered by the State:
 y Grant remission of land revenue as payable
 under the relevant Land Revenue Code for those 
farmers affected by drought. 
 y The State Government may postpone recovery of dues like T agai / T accavi, arrears of water, irrigation and electricity charges, or any other dues related to agriculture from farmers. If recovery is not postponed, the State Government can issue instructions for not recovering dues from the farmers and other agricultural workers by applying coercive measures.
 y The State Government may consider converting short-term loans and reschedule
 current 
installment of medium-term loans for farmers in the drought-affected areas. The State Government should make necessary provision for restructuring / rescheduling of these loans and pay to the concerned banks.
 y The State Government may issue instructions to all cooperative banks through the  Department of Cooperation to convert or reschedule kharif loans by the end of March, when assessment of crop losses are available and final annewari / paisewari values are published.
 y The Collector should furnish details of annewari / paisewari values or any other assessment of crop losses to cooperative banks to facilitate the conversion or re- scheduling of such loans. T ehsildars / Block Development Officer / Circle Officer can issue necessary certificates to the District Registrar of Cooperatives to enable
 the banks to grant conversion facility to the affected 
farmers.
 y The State Government may issue instructions to the cooperative banks not to apply coercive measures for recovering their loans or dues in the drought-affected areas.
 y The State Government can decide to waive education / examination fees for the students in Government schools located in drought-affected areas.

cAttle cAmps And fodder supply
Lead Agency: State Government departments of animal husbandry and the district 
administration.
Support Agency: Ministry of Agriculture & FW (Government of India), Indian Grassland  
and Forest Research Institute (IGFRI), Railways, State Agricultural Universities and Tribal / 
Forests produce marketing agencies.
Objectives: State Governments need to support their farmers in protecting their cattle 
population during a drought situation by providing necessary assistance for fodder , feed, 
and cattle health services. This would discourage distress selling of cattle and help farmers to maintain a very important part of their asset base.
Cattle wealth is the mainstay of the rural economy. As small and marginal farmers constitute 
about 80% of the total community of farmers in the country for whom, cattle often is a valuable asset to help supplement incomes from their small landholdings. Cattle ownership diversifies production and resource management options, increases total farm production and income, provides year-round employment and spreads risk. Studies shown that the more cattle heads a farmer owns, the less vulnerable the farmer is to risks. During a drought situation, every measure needs to be taken to save useful cattle from mortality or distress sale by making arrangements for drinking water, fodder and medicines etc.
 
Steps to provide fodder:
 y On receiving information about fodder scarcity becoming imminent as a result of failure or inadequacy of rains in July–August or the failure or inadequacy in rabi rains, the Collector should have surveys done for assessment of fodder availability, the price trends and the expected demand in the light of cattle population in vulnerable areas. The cattle census figures and other data with the District Animal Husbandry Officer will be useful for this purpose. 
 y The Collector should submit a detailed report to the State Government, which provides information on the cattle population, the area under fodder, the estimated fodder production and the shortage of fodder in the district. The Collector can suggest measures for increasing fodder supply in the area.
 y The State Government, upon the receipt of such a report, should issue detailed
 instructions for 
maintaining the supply of fodder , either through procurement of fodder, or by setting up cattle camps or fodder depots / bank, or by encouraging farmers to undertake fodder cultivation.
The State Government should authorize the Collector to ensure the availability of fodder in 
the drought-affected areas by taking the following steps:
75MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y Encourage farmers to undertake fodder cultivation on the banks of canals or other areas under 
irrigation. Subsidy in the form of seeds should be provided for fodder cultivation;
 y Request the Chief Conservator of Forests and Divisional Forest Officers to protect the available grass in the forests; and
 y Consider imposing a ban on the movement of fodder from the district to another district or outside the State.
Special Measures for Increasing Fodder Supply
 y The State Government should issue instructions to the Collector to take the following  measures 
for increasing the supplying of fodder:
 y Procure fodder through the Forest Department or the Forest Development  Corporation at 
a price fixed by the State Government;
 y Procure fodder through traders, private cultivators, Tribal Development Corporation etc. at a price declared by the State Government; 
 y Procure fodder from the neighbouring States. 
 y Procure feed blocks if necessary for milk-producing cattle and arrange strategic placement of feed reserves;
 y Establish fodder depots in the drought-affected T alukas for selling fodder, cattle
 feed and 
concentrates at a price fixed by the State Government;
 y Fix the price of fodder so that it is affordable to the farmers. Provide subsidy for the purchase of fodder supplied through fodder depots. The price should be published
 and displayed prominently 
in the fodder depot to make the farmers aware;
 y Maintain accounts of sale of fodder through fodder depots. These accounts need to be open to inspection;
 y Organize distribution of fodder through societies by way of T agai / T accavi to the needy agriculturists and particularly to small holders in the affected areas;
 y Set up cattle camps or feeding centres either through district administration or the NGOs for feeding the cattle.
 y Fix the quantity of fodder and feed to be provided in the cattle camp with the assistance of the State animal husbandry department. Fodder and feed should be issued for each cattle in accordance with these standards.
 y Arrange water supply for all the cattle camps in accordance with the total number of cattle admitted in these camps.
 y Maintain accounts of the fodder and feed provided through the cattle camps and reconcile it with the number of cattle staying in a cattle camp. Each cattle camp must maintain a register, showing the number of cattle staying there and the total
 stock of fodder and feed on a daily 
basis.
 y Conduct necessary inspection of cattle camps to ensure that fodder and feed are being provided to cattle in these camps and sanitation and cleanliness measures in these camps are adequate.
76MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y Arrange for grazing of cattle in army establishments, such as training centres or firing ranges;
 y Start a special scheme for arranging the supply of nutritious cattle feed to owners of milch cattle 
in consultation with the State Dairy Development Department;
 y Arrange with Gaushalas and other NGOs for taking care of cattle, on a per cattle  head payment 
basis; 
 y In extraordinary situations, the fodder requirement may be arranged through Railways from surplus States.
 y Increase awareness among farmers about the feeding requirements of cattle during drought to ensure their health and productivity; and
  Information on cattle camps and fodder supply can be provided through Form Nos. 5 and 6 , included in Annexure 1 .
  Based on the migration pattern of cattle, States may consider organizing cattle camps in the districts not affected by drought. 
  States may consider providing fodder to farmers who do not prefer to send their livestock to cattle camps.
  Promote drought resilient local grasses, shrubs, tree varieties on the banks of canals, water bodies etc. for moisture conservation. 
Role of the Animal Husbandry Department
 y At the request of the Collector, the State Animal Husbandry Department should make available the fodder, feed, and water requirement for each cattle.
 y The Animal Husbandry Department would check the quality of feed and fodder supplied through the fodder depots and cattle camps. It would ensure and certify that the feed and fodder being provided are fit for cattle consumption.
 y The Animal Husbandry Department would provide minerals, vitamins, medicines and vaccines at minimum cost to the farmers. The Department would also carry out the necessary inspections and checks in drought-affected areas to ensure that cattle are maintained in good health.
 y The Animal Husbandry Department would depute inspectors who would check the health of cattle in cattle camps at frequent intervals, at least once a week, and undertake all precautionary measures to avoid outbreak of any disease.
 y The Animal Husbandry Department would undertake campaigns in the drought- affected areas to increase the awareness of farmers about cattle health issues related
 to fodder and feed, vitamin 
and minerals and other sanitation issues.
Role of the Forest Department
 y At the request of the Collector, the Forest Department / Forest Development Corporation should maintain stocks of grass for the use of the distressed Cattle Population in the drought hit areas. The cutting of grass should be completed as early as possible and should be properly dried, converted to hay and stocked. The Forest Department should also make arrangements for the transportation of fodder to places suggested by the Collector. The Government should sanction the necessary expenditure for fodder operations to be undertaken by the Forest Department.
77MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Role of the Agriculture Department
 y The Agriculture Department through its various bodies and especially through ATMA, would 
encourage individual farmers to undertake cultivation of fodder, wherever possible. It would provide fodder seeds and fertilizers
 to the farmers for cultivating fodder, wherever possible; and 
extension services for undertaking short duration grasses and seasonal fodder crops.
 y The Agriculture Department can also undertake cultivation of fodder on the land  owned by 
the agricultural universities. Generally, agricultural universities have huge tracts of land, which could be used for this purpose. The Government needs to provide subsidy to the agriculture universities for cultivating fodder.
 y The Agriculture Department can also grow fodder on the seed farms, wherever available or on Demo plots under ATMA. The Government should provide a grant for seeds, fertilizers and other expenditures, depending on the extent of area covered under fodder cultivation.
Role of the Irrigation Department
 y The irrigation department should extend all necessary cooperation to the Collector  for promoting 
fodder cultivation by providing water for irrigation on a priority basis. Such water could be provided to the farmers at a cheaper rate.
 y The irrigation department should consider allowing reservoir and tank beds under its control to be leased out for cultivating short duration grasses or seasonal fodder crops. The Collector, with the permission of the irrigation department, could lease
 out the reservoir and tank bed land on 
short-term lease subject to the condition that the lessees should grow fodder crop therein and agree to sell the grass / fodder to needy farmers at the price to be fixed by the Collector.

institutionAl response
The effectiveness of Drought management response is a reflection of the robustness of the 
government institutional structures .
While primary responsibility to monitor, declare, plan and manage response is of the State 
Government, yet a critical supportive role is contemplated under the present scheme of things for the 
Central Government. The district administration headed by the Collector spearheads the government institutional response to drought on the ground. Drought thus requires efficient coordination at multiple levels.
Role of the Central  Government
 y The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare(DAC&FW), Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW) is responsible for monitoring and coordinating the central government response to drought.
 y An officer of the rank of an Additional Secretary in the DAC&FW is designated as the “Central Drought Relief
 Commissioner”  for the purpose. SDRF and NDRF are, however , 
administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs and assistance under these schemes are released by the Ministry of Finance upon the recommendation of the High Level Committee  (HLC).
 y A Crisis Management Group functions under the Chairmanship of the Central
 Drought Relief 
Commissioner with representatives of Ministries and organizations. The Crisis Management Group meets from time to time to review the drought situation in the country and progress of relief
 measures.
 y The CWWG, is an arrangement for monitoring and early warning of any drought like development in any part of the country on a regular basis. 
 y In the event of a declaration of drought, the Central Drought Relief Commissioner (CDRC) should monitor and review the progress of relief measures and apprise the National Crisis Management Committee. 
 y National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) which has been set up under the Chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary with Secretaries of Ministries and heads of agencies as members to deal with all calamities and crisis situation should be apprised of the progress of relief and other developments periodically. 
 y The Central Government normally constitutes a Cabinet Sub-committee or a Group of Ministers in situations of severe drought to expedite policy decisions.
 y The MoA&FW is expected to coordinate closely with other Ministries and agencies in dealing with drought. 
Role of the State Government
 y The State Department of Disaster Management and Relief is responsible for directing drought operations in the State.
 y The Department is headed by a Secretary or Relief Commissioner and assisted by a team of officers. 
80MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y The Relief Commissioner / Secretary, Disaster Management monitors the drought situation 
through the Drought Management Centres, the District Collectors and departments and agencies. 
 y The Relief Commissioner / Secretary, Disaster Management submits periodic reports to the Government and recommends the declaration of drought on the basis of situation on the ground. Once the State Government declares drought, all necessary orders for relief operations are issued. 
 y Relief Commissioners / Secretary, Disaster Management issue instructions to Collectors for launching relief operations for the people affected by drought.
 y Relief Commissioner / Secretary, Disaster Management should take steps for timely communication of all decisions of the State Government to the district authorities.
 y The Relief Commissioner / Secretary, Disaster Management administers the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) of the State and issues orders for release of all financial
 assistance to the 
district administration and other departments in accordance with extant guidelines.
 y The Relief Commissioner / Secretary, Disaster Management shall ensure the assessment of losses and relief requirements in consultation with the district administration and line departments. On the basis of this assessment a Memorandum is submitted to Government of India by the State Relief Commissioner for seeking financial assistance from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).
 y States have adopted various mechanisms for managing drought like State Executive Committee in accordance with the provision of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Cabinet Sub-committee, Secretaries’ Committee under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary for taking policy decisions on drought. 
 y Drought management requires coordination with departments of agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, water resources, irrigation, social welfare, public distribution, rural development, school education, power, drinking water, public health, and finance. 
Role of the District Administration
 y The district administration under the leadership of the Collector implements all  decisions 
related to drought management on the ground. The implementation takes places through a number of line departments and field agencies working on the ground. The effectiveness of drought management is largely dependent upon coordination among agencies working at the district level.
 y As per extant revenue codes in many States, the expression “Collector” includes all subordinate officials of the Revenue Department such as Additional Collector, Deputy Collector, Sub- divisional Officer and T ehsildar. All the subordinate officers perform their tasks and exercise powers related to drought management on behalf of the Collector.
 y The Collectors should ensure monitoring all the indicators of drought on the ground such as, collection of daily data on rainfall water storage position, water availability and supply and progress of sowing operations. The Collector should also monitor local information related to demand for relief employment, prices of food grains and the availability of fodder.
81MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y The Collector shall ensure timely collection of field information and ground truthing as described 
in Chapter 3. 
 y The Collector must submit periodical reports on all the important indicators of drought to the Government. 
 y The State Government must ensure that delegation of administrative and financial power to the Collectors are sufficient for a prompt and meaningful response.
 y The Collector must be authorized to direct all the line departments at the district level to participate in drought management, prepare contingency plans and mobilize their staff and resources e.g. in the identification of works and preparation of estimates for shelf o f  p ro g re s s for relief
 employment in the drought-affected areas. The Collector should be authorized to 
requisition vehicles  and equipments on payment basis to mount relief operation.
 y The Collector needs to assess the situation related to scarcity of drinking water and fodder and issue appropriate instructions regarding reservation of drinking water , supply of drinking water through tankers, procurement and sale of fodder, and setting up of fodder depots and cattle camps as mentioned in the relevant
 sections of the manual. The Collector should exercise similar 
authority in any other area which is affected by drought.
 y The role of the Collector is that of an effective coordinator of drought management. The Collector must be able to provide a sense of mission and direction to all the line departments and agencies working for drought relief. It is necessary that the Collector provides the necessary help and support to all the agencies for performing their tasks more effectively.
 y At the district level, a district drought / disaster management committee should
 be set up under 
the chairmanship of the Collector with members consisting of public representatives, line departments. The SDMCs and DDMCs shall provide all relevant information to the said Committee. The Committee should meet frequently and review the progress of drought relief measures in the district. The district-level committee can become a very effective forum for addressing peoples’
 
concerns and applying correctives in drought management.
Role of Panchayati Raj Institutions
 y It is necessary to involve the Panchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) - Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samitis, and Village Panchayats - in the implementation of drought management programmes.
 y PRIs need to provide funds for water conservation and maintenance of water supply schemes.
 y Efforts should be made to identify the projects related to sustainable natural resource management, water conservation etc. to support drought mitigation in the vulnerable regions.
 y The PRIs need to play an important role in the regulation of water use at the individual household and village level. It should recommend using water resources for the purpose of drinking and fodder cultivation.
Role of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organizations 
(CSOs)
 y The State Government and district administration need to involve NGOs in organizing 
drought relief. NGOs and CSOs have the advantage of local presence and community outreach which could be utilized for organizing distribution of relief assistance and implementing 
82MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
mitigation programs. NGOs can also be very effective in providing feedback to the Government 
and securing corrective actions.
 y The State Government and district administration can set up a coordination forum for NGOs and CSOs at the State and district levels respectively. The coordination forum meetings can be convened to discuss the drought situation and the implementation of relief programmes.
 y NGOs and CSOs can monitor various indicators of drought, particularly its impact on the people, and bring these to the attention of the State Government. The State Government can initiate necessary relief measures in drought-affected areas, based on the feedback from these organizations.
 y NGOs and CSOs can convey the local demand for relief employment to the district administration. They can suggest specific works to be started so that the people
 are provided 
with employment within a short distance of their homes. These organizations can help the district administration in planning relief employment
 in a way that durable community assets 
are created. They can also coordinate with the local administration in ensuring the payment of wages and foodgrains on time.
 y NGOs and CSOs can work with the local community in augmenting the sources of drinking water through repairing wells, hand-pumps, tanks, ponds and any other local water structure. They can also help the community in regulating water use within the community and ensuring equitable distribution of available water.
 y NGOs and CSOs can monitor the distribution of foodgrains through Fair Price Shops and prevent hoarding and diversion of foodgrains in the open market. They can ensure that foodgrains are supplied to all the Fair Price Shops, particularly those in the remote areas and all the people in the drought-affected areas can purchase foodgrains through these shops as per their entitlements. NGOs and CSOs can also
 monitor that the people are paid their wages in the form of foodgrains 
as per the norms fixed by the government.
 y NGOs and CSOs can provide assistance to the sick, elderly and disabled people in the drought situation. They can run community kitchens with Government assistance. NGOs need to bring the cases of hunger and starvation to the attention of the Government.
 y In consultation with the Government, NGOs and CSOs can monitor the functioning of ICDS and mid-day meals so that the children get necessary nutrition during the period of drought. They can also bring to the attention of the Government the cases of malnutrition among infants and children.
 y NGOs and CSOs can set up cattle camps and fodder depots after obtaining the necessary authorization from the Government. They can receive Government assistance as per the SDRF / NDRF norms as well as the necessary veterinary care for this purpose.
 y NGOs and CSOs need to help the Government in dealing with the public health
 aspects of 
drought. They can assist the Government in disinfecting sources of water, creating awareness about public health issues and monitoring malnutrition and disease among drought-affected population.
83MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
finAncing relief expenditure
In post-independent India, financing relief expenditure has largely been arranged through the 
Finance Commission appointed under Article 280 of the Constitution. In the earlier phases, the 
role of the Commission was restricted to suggesting the pattern of financial assistance by the centre. Subsequently, the recommendations were enlarged to cover the “scheme of financing relief expenditure” .
The present arrangement of financing relief expenditure has two streams: (i) SDRF and (ii) NDRF.
The SDRF envisaged the contribution of Central and the concerned State Governments 
in the ratio of 3:1 for a fund to be kept outside the Government Account so that there is no cash 
flow constraint for initiating relief operations. The Centre’ s share is normally released in two half-yearly installments, subject to the guidelines in this regard. Funds from the SDRF are to be spent on specific, pre-determined items of expenditure at predetermined scales, as specified in the SDRF guidelines. The NDRF provides funds for natural calamities of severe nature when the balances available in the SDRF are not adequate for meeting relief expenditures. It is replenished through a surcharge on certain central
 taxes. The Thirteenth Finance Commission had recommended 
the use of NDRF for “ calamities of severe nature” ,  this fund is used to meet the expenditure on all natural
 calamities as recommended by Finance Commissions from time to time, where relief  
expenditure exceeds the amount balance in the SDRF.
The Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure), Government of India releases  assistance 
from both the SDRF and NDRF.  The SDRF is released to all the States in normal  course, irrespective 
of its level of relief expenditure, while the NDRF funds are released  when the States make specific 
requests, following a well-laid out procedure.
Administration of SDRF
The State Government needs to take following steps for the administration of SDRF:
 y Check the opening balance of the SDRF in the beginning of the financial year. All money that remains unspent at the end of preceding financial year is shown as the opening balance in the next financial year.
 y Submit an utilization certificate for the amount spent through the SDRF, well in time so that the SDRF allocations are released twice in year.
 y Get the SDRF expenditures audited through the Office of Accountant-General. These audit reports must be submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.
Release of NDRF Funds
 y Whenever a State faces a calamity of severe nature and the expenditure from the SDRF exceeds its existing balance, a request is made to the Government of India for release of funds from the 
84MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
NDRF. For drought, hailstorm, pest-attack and cold wave/frost, the request is made to the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and for other identified natural calamities,  the Ministry of 
Home Affairs has the necessary jurisdiction.
 y The State Government submits the request for release of NDRF funds through a Memorandum. A Memorandum is an important representation of the State Government, providing detailed information on the geographical extent and severity of drought, losses and damages in all the sectors, relief needs, and the request for assistance from the NDRF.
 y A Memorandum needs to be a balanced document, objectively describing the drought situation, assessing the impact and estimating the relief needs. The structure and template for preparation of a Memorandum is included in  Annexure  4 .
 y The State Government should submit the Memorandum to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare  only after declaring drought.
 y After the State Government declares drought and submits the Memorandum, the Ministry of Agriculture sends an Inter-Ministerial Central T eam (IMCT) to the concerned State for making an assessment of the drought situation. This team consists of officials from different Central Government Ministries/Departments, such as Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Food, Rural Development, Power, Drinking  Water, NITI Aayog, Finance, Home etc.
 y The team carries out extensive visits of drought-affected areas in the State during which it is expected to assess ground level situation pertaining to crop damage, drinking water, fodder shortage etc., meet local officials, farmers, PRI members, women’ s groups, etc. 
 y The team then submits a report to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare immediately after conclusion of its visit. The report should provide an assessment of the drought situation in terms of severity, geographical spread, impact on agriculture, availability of water , food, and fodder.
 y In the report, the team makes a recommendation for NDRF assistance in accordance with the SDRF guidelines. The recommendation needs to be clear , precise and objective and in consonance with the SDRF / NDRF norms for assistance.
 y The report of the team is considered by Sub Committee of the National Executive Committee(SC-NEC) which is an Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by the Secretary, D A C&FW ( Government of India) and recommendation made on the quantum of assistance from the NDRF.
 y The SC-NEC recommendation is considered by a High-Level Committee (HLC), consisting of the Union Home Minister , Union Finance Minister , Union Agriculture Minister and Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. The HLC is chaired by the senior- most Union Cabinet Minister.
 y After the HLC decision on the SC-NEC recommendation, funds from the NDRF are released by the Department of Expenditure on the advice of the MHA after adjusting for the existing balance in the SDRF. 
Development Programmes for Drought Relief
 y In addition to the SDRF and NDRF, the Central and State Governments need to take advantage of centrally sponsored schemes etc., which permit use of 10% of the allocation as flexifunds to be used for drought mitigation. 
85MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y The MGNREGS, National Rural Drinking Water Programme, water conservation programmes can 
play an important role in drought relief. 
 y All districts covered through these programmes need to be directed about using these programmes for generating employment in the drought-affected areas and building assets, such as tanks and wells, which can reduce the impact of drought.
 y At the State and district levels, water supply schemes, regular schemes for fodder cultivation and agriculture can be used for supporting various measures of drought relief.
 y The State Governments need to monitor Crop Insurance Schemes effectively especially in vulnerable districts. 
Monitoring Drought Expenditures
 y The State Government should monitor their drought expenditures regularly. Such monitoring mechanisms should consist of monthly expenditure statements, utilization certificates and internal and external audits.
The district administration must provide monthly expenditure statements on various relief 
measures in a format prescribed by the Government.
The district administration and implementing departments / agencies should
 submit 
utilization certificates for the amount released for drought relief. Further releases should not be made until the utilization certificate is provided.
The State Government needs to organize concurrent audit of expenditures through its internal 
audit wings so that course corrections can be applied on expenditures for various relief measures.
 Information on drought relief expenditures can be submitted in Form No. 12, included in 
Annexure 1.
86MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
informA tion mAnAgement And mediA  coordinA tion
 y State Drought Monitoring Centre shall provide information on a proactive basis to the 
Government.
 y The Central and State Governments should provide information on all aspects of drought to the people and media as and when necessary. 
 y The State Government should develop a Drought Management Information System (DMIS) cover ing different aspects of drought management. 
 y DMIS for drought should include information upon key indicators of drought and important interventions for relief. DMIS should be updated on a regular basis.
 y Secretary, Disaster Management / Relief Commissioner should consider submitting reports on the drought situation to the State Government/SEC. Form No. 12, included in Annexure 1, can be used for preparing such a report.
 y Secretary, Disaster Management / Relief Commissioner should consider documentation of the drought management efforts for guidance in dealing with future droughts. 
 y State Governments may set up helpline desk to provide information to all the concerned.  State Governments could also make use of the Kisan Call Centres (KCCs) and M-Kisan portal of DAC&FW for communicating audio/text messages and advisories to farmers in drought affected areas. Audio conferencing of experts with the farmers registered with KCCs and M-kisan portal also could be considered. The State Governments could consider training the Farm Tele Advisors of KCCs so as to enable them to render proper advice and suggestions to the farmers in the drought affected areas.
Coordination with Media
 y Sharing information with print, radio and television media, is an important aspect of drought management.
Usage of latest ICT technologies for out reach to farmers through Social Media and specially 
designed Apps and platforms like Facebook/Whatsapp to send recorded short videos/audio messages etc could also be considered by the State Governments, depending on the level of reach/accessibility of the farmers in the areas.
Drought Impact Assessment and evaluation of Response System
States need to take up “Drought impact assessment and evaluation of response system” . It is 
suggested to take up enumerative sample based house hold surveys with properly designed questionnaires and capture the impact of drought and evaluate the response system. The information available through various drought indices need to be considered in generating random sample for inventory.
The impact assessment and evaluation of response system is suggested to be taken up as a 
follow up for every event of drought declaration event in the State. 
87MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
The studies will bring out community expectations vis a vis the interventions taken up as relief 
measures and help in tuning the programs to meet the local needs to the possible extent.  These kind 
of studies shall be taken up by reputed institutions or experts with domain knowledge.
Crop Insurance
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Y ojana (PMFBY):
The PMFBY is a new crop insurance scheme launched by the government from the kharif season 
of 2016. The scheme is aimed at making crop insurance easier, more meaningful and attractive to the farmers. 
The major features of PMFBY are:
 y PMFBY will provide a comprehensive insurance cover against failure of the crop thus help stabilize 
the income of farmers and encourage them in the adoption of innovative practices. 
 y The Scheme can cover all food & oilseeds crops and annual commercial/ horticultural crops for which past yield data is available and for which requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) will be conducted as a part of the General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES). 
 y The scheme is compulsory for loanee farmers obtaining Crop Loan /KCC account for notified crops, but is voluntary for Other/non loanee farmers.  
 y The Maximum Premium payable by the farmers will be 2% for all Kharif food & oilseeds crops, 1.5% for Rabi food & oilseeds crops and 5% for annual commercial/horticultural crops.
 y The difference between premium and the rate of Insurance charges payable by farmers shall be shared equally by the Centre and State. 
 y The seasonality discipline shall be same for loanee and non-loanee farmers. 
 y The scheme will be implemented by Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) and other empanelled private general insurance companies. Selection of Implementing Agency (IA) will be done by the concered State Government through bidding. 
 y The existing State Level Co-ordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI), Sub-Committee to SLCCCI, District Level Monitoring Committee (DLMC) shall be responsible for proper management of the Scheme. 
 y The Scheme shall be implemented on an ‘Area Approach basis’ . The unit of insurance shall be Village/Village Panchayat level for major crops and for other crops it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/Village Panchayat. 
 y The Loss assessment for crop losses due to non-preventable natural risks will be on Area approach. 
 y In case of majority of insured crops of a notified area are prevented from sowing/planting the insured crops due to adverse weather conditions that will be eligible for indemnity claims upto maximum of 25% of the sum-insured. 
 y However losses due to localised perils (Hailstorm, landslide & inundation) and Post-Harvest losses due to specified perils, (Cyclone/Cyclonic rain & Unseasonal rains) shall be assessed at the affected insured field of the individual insured farmer. 
88MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
 y Three levels of Indemnity, viz., 70%, 80% and 90% corresponding to crop Risk in the areas shall 
be available for all crops. 
 y The Threshold Yield (TY) shall be the benchmark yield level at which Insurance protection shall be given to all the insured farmers in an Insurance Unit Threshold of the notified crop will be moving average of yield of last seven years excluding yield upto two notified calamity years multiplied by Indemnity level. 
 y In case of smaller States, the whole State shall be assigned to one IA (2-3 for comparatively big States). Selection of IA may be made for at least 3 years. 
 y The designated / empanelled companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified / to be notified by the State Govt. and non-compliance will lead to rejection of company’s bid.
 y Crop Cutting Experiments (CCE) shall be undertaken per unit area /per crop, on a sliding scale, as prescribed under the scheme outline and operational guidelines. Improved Technology like Remote sensing, Drone etc. will be utilised for estimation of yield losses.
 y State governments should use Smart phone apps for video/image capturing CCEs process and transmission thereof with CCE data on a real time basis for timely, reliable and transparent estimation of yield data 
 y The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCEs etc. will be shared between Central Government and State/U.T. Governments on 50:50 basis. 
 y There will be a provision of on account claims in case of adverse seasonal conditions during crop season viz. floods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought, and unseasonal rains. 
 y On account payment upto 25% of likely claims will be provided, if the expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of normal yield. 
 y The claim amount will be credited electronically to the individual Insured Bank Account. 
 y Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/ areas.
State Governments need to participate in these PMFBY and ensure that the insurance coverage 
increases to 50% of farmers. Farmers need to be informed about the availability of insurance products and educated about the need for managing their yield and income risks by getting insurance coverage. As the coverage of agricultural insurance in the country     increases, insurance schemes for drought protection would become more viable.

95MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
The containment and mitigation of the crippling impact of drought, and the eventual attainment 
of the objective of drought proofing of an area is contingent upon a proactive and relentless, but 
planned pursuit of a combination of structural / physical and non-structural long and short term measures.  The short term measures are mostly reactive or relief centric in nature and mostly relate to in-season drought management through contingency planning and relief distribution.  Long term mitigation measures are geared towards the adaptation to climate change, restoration of ecological balance through adoption of sustainable agronomic and conservation practices, sensible crop choices etc.  Most of these measures are translated on the ground through soil and water conservation, watershed management, agronomic practices suited to rainfed agriculture and forestry programmes that seek to integrate soil, water and forestry management in an ecological compliant and sustainable manner.
Drought mitigation needs to be ensconced in the regular development programmes of the 
Centre and State Governments. Some of the most significant current national programmes that may have a decisive bearing on drought mitigation are Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna, National Rainfed Area Development Programme, National Rural Drinking Water Programme etc.  Many of these programmes can be guided towards the development of  a cogent drought mitigation strategy at the State level by taking advantage of the flexibility which has been in-built into the centrally sponsored schemes for the purposes of mitigation of calamities like drought.
Current Drought Mitigation Programmes 
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Y ojana (PMKSY)
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) has been formulated with the vision of 
extending the coverage of irrigation ‘Har Khet ko pani’ and improving water use efficiency ‘More crop per drop’ in a focused manner with end to end solution on source creation, distribution, management, field application and extension activities. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was approved by the Central Government in 2015-16.
PMKSY has been formulated as an umbrella scheme amalgamating ongoing schemes viz. 
Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) of the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD&GR), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) of Department of Land Resources (DoLR) and the On Farm Water Management (OFWM) of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW). The Ministry-wise activities are presented in Table 1.
The major objective of PMKSY is to achieve convergence of investments in major and medium 
irrigation projects with command area development to provide assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency to reduce wastage of water, enhance the adoption of precision-irrigation and other water saving technologies (More crop per drop), scientific and sustainable development of watersheds, enhance recharge of aquifers and introduce sustainable water conservation practices and attract greater private investment in precision irrigation system.
District Irrigation Plans (DIPs) shall be the cornerstone for planning and implementation of 
PMKSY. DIPs will identify the gaps in irrigation infrastructure after taking into consideration the District Agriculture Plans (DAPs) already prepared for Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) vis-à-vis 
96MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
irrigation infrastructure currently available and resources that would be added during XII Plan from 
other ongoing schemes (both State and Central), like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Rural Infrastructure  
Development Fund (RIDF), Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme, Member of Legislative Assembly Local Area Development (MLALAD) Scheme, Local body funds etc. The gaps identified under Strategic Research & Extension Plan (SREGP) will be made use in preparation of DIP .
DIPs will present holistic irrigation development perspective of the district outlining medium to 
long term development plans integrating three components viz. water sources, distribution network and water use applications incorporating all usage of water like drinking & domestic use, irrigation and industry. Preparation of DIP will be taken up as joint exercise of all participating departments. DIP will form the compendium of all existing and proposed water resource network system in the district.
The DIPs may be prepared at two levels, the block and the district. Keeping in view the convenience 
of map preparation and data collection, the work would be primarily done at block level. Block wise irrigation plan is to be prepared depending on the available and potential water resources and water requirement for agriculture sector prioritising the activities based on socio-economic and location specific requirement. In case planning is made based on basin/sub basin level, the comprehensive irrigation plan may cover more than one district. The activities identified in the basin/sub-basin plan can be further segregated into district/block level action plans. Use of satellite imagery, topo sheets and available database may be appropriately utilised for developing irrigation plans at least on pilot basis to begin with and subsequently may be extended to all projects.
State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary of the respective States 
are authorized to sanction projects, oversee its implementation and monitoring. National Executive Committee (NEC) under the Chairmanship of Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog will oversee programme implementation, allocation of resources, inter-ministerial coordination, monitoring & performance assessment, addressing administrative issues. At National level, programme is to be supervised and monitored by an Inter-Ministerial National Steering Committee (NSC) under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble Prime Minister with Union Ministers of concerned Ministries as a Member.

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) 
Considering the importance of water conservation, and given all the scientific and technological 
advances at their command, the Ministry of Rural Development in consultation and agreement 
with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has developed an actionable Framework to ensure that MGNREGS funds are used in accordance with the best practices in the sector. 
The need for drought proofing villages in water stressed blocks was being felt for many years. 
Many State Governments have started excellent initiatives for water conservation in last few years using Mahatma Gandhi NREGA funds viz. the  ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swalalamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, the ‘Dobha’ or Farm Ponds construction in Jharkhand, the ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana. ‘Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, ‘Kapil Dhara’ in Madhya Pradesh, bore well recharge in Karnataka, ‘Jalyukt Shivar’ in Maharashtra are some of the recent initiatives. The present Framework draws on many of the good practices in these States and some other initiatives.
The Framework strives to leverage the synergies between Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, Pradhan 
Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, IWMP and Command Area Development & Water Management programmes, given their common objectives. Types of common works undertaken under these programmes/ schemes are water conservation and management, water harvesting, soil and moisture conservation, groundwater recharge, flood protection, land development, Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM). These programmes were addressing the above mentioned activities with their own set of planning tools, processes, technical expertise and financial resources which is now envisioned to be used in coordination to bring the advantages of each programmes/ schemes to strengthen a concerted action for water conservation and management. 
The highlights of the Frameworks are:-
 y Paradigm shift from Relief Works approach to Integrated Natural Resource Management 
(INRM) approach in implementation of MGNREGS.
  Planned and systematic development of land and harnessing of rainwater following watershed principles to become the central focus of MGNREGS works.
  All lands falling under the watershed will be developed on ridge to valley treatment principle.
  Individual works (including work on private land) will be logically sequenced and packaged together on the principles of INRM, to form projects following the principles of watershed management in an integrated manner.
  Systematic identification, planning and implementation of projects leading to creation of sustainable and productive assets for the community.
 y District as synergizing unit for convergent planning under the leadership of the District Collector.
  With the convergence of the ongoing schemes in the area, a comprehensive project of village/ watershed/ command area, incorporating/ integrating all the works/ activities required for the integrated development of the village/ watershed/ CAD approach is to be prepared.
100MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
  Support of institutions like IITs, NIITs, Agricultural Universities, State technical institutions, 
professionals sourced as part of Corporate Social Responsibility and Universities as a part of the ‘Unnat Bharat Abhiyan’ to be promoted.
  The DPC to ensure that the Natural Resource Management component of Labour Budget of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is essentially made part of the District Irrigation Plan (DIP).
  Technical inputs from the joint pool of IWMP in Watershed Cell cum Data Centre, Mahatma Gandhi NREGA unit, Water Resource Department, the Agriculture department, Regional Office of Central Water Commission (CWC). 
 y Consultation with National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), ISRO to leverage the GIS solution for planning and monitoring for Natural Resource Management.
 y Community based participatory planning and creation of sustainable livelihoods by involving the Self Help Groups (SHGs) under National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) in the planning and implementation of watershed projects under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.
 y Ratification by the Gram Panchayat(s) for shelf of projects.
Under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, 153 works  are permissible  of which 100   relate to NRM alone 
(of which 71 are water related works). Refer Annexure I
As per the list provided by Central Ground Water Board, 112 districts from 13 states are categorised 
as most ‘Irrigation Deprived’ Districts. Due to over utilisation of ground water, 1068 blocks (from 18 States) and 217 blocks (from 17 States) categorised as ‘Over Exploited Blocks and Critical Blocks' respectively.
In upcoming years i.e. FY 2017-18 and onwards, focus will be given to these ‘Irrigation Deprived’ 
districts and ‘Water Stressed’ Blocks.
Technological support will be taken from National Remote Sensing Centre, ISRO for identification 
and planning of watersheds and monitoring of each and every activity undertaken and missed out. Central Ground Water Board is storehouse of information related to groundwater resource and have technical expertise available at regional/ State level on designs and structures suitable/ required for water stressed blocks based on their geomorphological and climatic zone.
Creation of sustainable livelihoods is one of the desired outputs of NRM/ IWMP works; hence, the 
Self Help Groups (SHGs) under NRLM will be closely involved in the planning and implementation of watershed projects under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. The Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojna farmers falling under these areas shall be linked on priority basis.
Watershed management works can be taken up independently under MGNREGA where there 
is no IWMP project sanctioned/proposed and in convergence with IWMP- wherever IWMP project is already sanctioned and proposed (new IWMP Projects).
101MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
The comprehensive watershed plan shall be prepared in accordance with the concepts of ridge to 
valley treatment. It is recommended to use the satellite imagery for this planning work. For selection 
of the appropriate sites and preparing the above plans, the Engineers/Technical Assistants and Mates of MGNREGS at Block and GP level would be trained and supported by the State Level Nodal Agency (SLNA) of IWMP and technical personnel of WCDC, the cost of which would be met by the Administrative cost of MGNREGS.  Watershed works will preferably be taken up in cluster approach.
Drought Mitigation measures
The objectives of these mitigation measures are to reduce soil erosion, augment soil moisture, 
restrict surface run-off of rainwater and improve the efficiency of water use. It involves a wide range of soil and water conservation measures and farm practices.
Water Harvesting and Conservation
Water harvesting and conservation refer to processes and structures of rainfall and run- off  
collection from large catchments area and channelling them for human consumption. In India, these processes and structures have been in existence since antiquity, but the increasing frequency and severity of droughts and population growth have focused on the revival of these practices and structures. Every household’s minimum water requirements can be easily met by collecting rainwater locally from village / community ponds / large manmade containers, by diverting and storing water from local streams / springs and by tapping sub-surface water below river / stream beds.
There are two methods for water conservation: (i) artificial recharge of groundwater, and 
(ii) traditional methods. While the artificial recharge of groundwater is used extensively in all the watershed development programmes being implemented, traditional methods of water collection and harvesting through ponds / tanks are even more important for assuring continuous and reliable access to water. Both methods include measures which are low-cost, community-oriented and environment-friendly. It is necessary for the Government and NGOs working in the area of water conservation to promote both sets of measures, depending on the local conditions.
These methods are considered very useful for groundwater recharge both when rainfall is deficient 
and when there are flash floods (that result in overtopping of defined courses of rivers / streams and their spreading into flood plains). Harvesting and conservation of floodwater to rejuvenate depleted high-capacity aquifers by adopting integrated groundwater recharge techniques, such as dams, tanks, anicuts, percolation tanks, could improve water availability and create a water buffer for dealing with successive droughts.

103MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Artificial Recharge of Ground Water
A typical watershed development programme has several components, depending on the 
topography (shape, configuration and slope of the land), nature and depth of soil cover, type of rocks 
and their pattern of formation and layout, water absorbing capacity of land, rainfall intensity and land use. These include the following:
Contour Bunding
Contour bunding is one of the most widely practised soil and water conservation measures, 
which controls erosion, conserves moisture, recharges groundwater and prevents silting of tanks and reservoirs in the downstream. The practice comprises constructing narrow-base bunds on contour to impound runoff water behind them, so that impounded water is absorbed gradually into the soil profile.
Contour bunding works are undertaken in shallow and medium soils. An area extending from the 
ridge-line (topmost line) to the valley-line (lowest line) is called a catchment. For a bunding project, a self-defended catchment (i.e. the topmost end of the catchment in the selected area is such that no water from outside the catchment drains into it) is selected. In the selected catchment, bunds are constructed on contours. The bunds are normally impounded upto a height of 30 cm. The spacing of the bund is decided based on the slope of the land and the nature of the soil. For gently sloping lands, with 2–3% slope, the bunds are nearly 200 feet apart. The section of a bund is also dependent on the value of the soil. In light soil, the section is 10 square feet, whereas in medium soil it is 24 square feet. About 25 mm of rainwater could be stored at a soil depth of 130–150 mm for growing crops. On average, contour bunds had 27% higher soil moisture and 14–180% higher yield than flat surfaces.
Contour Trenching
This consists of excavating shallow / intermittent trenches across the land slope and forming a 
small earthen bund on the downstream side. Plantation is done on the bund to stabilize the bund. The trenches retain the runoff and help in the establishment of plantations made on the bund.
Trenches are useful where the land surface is fairly porous. Rainwater that gets collected in the 
trenches can quickly percolate into the ground. The spacing of trenches and their size (i.e. length, width and depth) should be adequate to intercept about 50% of the peak rainfall in semi-arid regions (annual rainfall of about 400–550 mm). The trenches should be cleaned and desilted periodically.
Contour Cultivation
Contour operations are done across the slope by cultivating crops and trees on the contour. 
The contour furrows created would form a multitude of mini barriers across the flow path of the runoff. Contour cultivation remains the most effective on moderate slopes of 2–7%. The water in the furrows gets collected in the depressions. Perennial grasses can be grown in such depressions. Another practice called strip cropping involves growing parallel rows of erosion-resistant crops to control loss of surface soil, with other crops grown in between.
104MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Bench Terracing
Bench terracing is practis ed on steep hilly slopes where agriculture has replaced natural 
forest and grasslands since a long time. Thus, further reduction in slope length would reduce the 
intensity of runoff water. Bench terracing involves converting the original ground into level step-
like fields constructed by half cutting and half filling, which reduces the degree of the slope. This 
approach of bench terracing for agro-forestry models is gradually becoming popular in the hilly 
areas of Nilgiris, north-east India and Himachal Pradesh.
Graded Bunding
Graded bunds are constructed in relatively high rainfall areas. The excess water has to be removed 
out of the field to avoid water stagnation, especially in deep black soils. These bunds are outlets for 
safe removal of water. The channels of graded bunds are wide and shallow.
Gully plugging
Gully plug, as the name implies is a small conservation structure across small gullies and streams 
in hilly areas to slow the run-off of the flowing water. Gullies result from functional disorder of the land, improper land use and are the most visible result of severe soil erosion. They are small drainage channels, which cannot be easily crossed by agricultural equipment. Gully plugging measures include vegetative plantings and brushwood check dams, boulder bunds, brick masonry and earthen bunds or a combination of both and sand bag plugs.
Check Dams / Nalla Bunding Construction
Check dam / nalla bunding work consists of construction of a masonry embankment across a 
stream or nalla with surplussing arrangement (waste weirs, at suitable intervals).
These works are undertaken to hold maximum runoff water to create temporary flooding in the 
stream with arrangements to drain water at suitable intervals. Such embankments depend on the slope of the nalla or off-stream and the quantity of water expected to flow. The impounding of water facilitates percolation of water into deeper soil and makes it possible to bring under cultivation the land under the bed of the nallas. The water released from these bunds is free from silt and very low in velocity and thus unable to cause erosion. Thus, water can be utilized optimally.
Gabion Structure
This is a commonly constructed check dam across small streams to conserve stream flows with 
practically no submergence beyond the stream course. Locally available boulders are stored in a steel wire. This is put up across the stream’s mesh to make a small dam by anchoring it to the streamside. The height of such structures is around 0.5 m and is normally used in 10–15 m wide streams. The cost of such structures is around Rs.10,000–15,000. The excess water overflows from this structure storing some water in reserve which serves as a source of recharge. The silt content of stream water in due course is deposited in the interstices of the boulders to make it more impermeable. These structures are common in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.
105MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Stream Bank Protection
Eroding stream banks not only damage adjoining agricultural lands but also contribute large 
quantities of sediment load to the river systems. Under the watershed management programme, 
bank protection of only small / minor streams is included. However, works of this nature should only be taken up if the benefits justify the cost of construction.
The works usually involved are that of boulder pitching on banks of about 20–30 cm thickness 
after dressing the bank to a stable slope. Where the flow velocity of the stream is high (1.5 m/sec or more) gabion structures should be built at the toe of the bank with the foundation firmly embedded in the streambed and bank.
Farm Ponds
In any watershed management programme farm ponds are an important component and useful 
in storing water for irrigation. They also retard sediment and flood flows to the downstream river system. In a relatively flat terrain with good soil cover, a farm pond has an earth section with usually 3:1 side slopes on the waterside and 2:1 side slopes on the downstream face (a uniform side slope of 2½:1 on both sides can be adopted at some sites). The sides are sodded. A natural depression nearby should be used as an earthen spillway with minimum channel section construction. A pipe drop inlet spillway and an irrigation outlet are also provided. A key trench is dug to provide good bondage between the original ground and the filled earth. Storm riprap against wave action may be required in some cases. The pond crest usually serves as a farm road (provide 4.25 m roadway for motorable roads).
A good pond site should possess the following traits:
 y The site for the earthen bund should be a narrow gorge with a fan shaped valley above so that a 
small amount of earthwork provides large storage.
 y The drainage area above the pond should be large enough to fill the pond in 2 or 3 spells of good rainfall.
 y The pond location should be near where the water is to be used; e.g. for irrigation, it should be above the irrigated fields and for sediment control it should intercept the flow from the most erodible parts of the catchment.
 y The junction of two drainage channels or large natural depressions should be preferred.
 y The land surface should not have excessive seepage losses unless it is meant to serve as a percolation tank for groundwater recharge.
Percolation Tanks (PT) / Spreading Basin
One of the effective measures by which groundwater recharge can be achieved, is by the 
construction and use of percolation tanks. The efficacy and feasibility of percolation tanks is better established in hard rock formation where the rocks are highly fractured and weathered.
In Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat, numerous percolation 
tanks are constructed in basaltic lava flows and crystalline rocks.
106MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Percolation tanks are constructed for very small catchments up to 10–12 sq. km., where minor 
irrigation schemes, bandharas or other storage schemes are not technically and economically 
feasible. Percolation tank schemes are intended mainly for recharging aquifers and improving the groundwater supply to the wells for drinking water and irrigation. In comparison to ponds, percolation tanks conserve water to a greater extent because the filling and recharge occur mostly during the monsoons when the evaporation rate is about the half of the potential rate in summer through which ponds contain water. Selection of a suitable site for the construction of percolation tanks and subsequent maintenance is crucial for its effective functioning. Where hydro-geological conditions are favourable, percolation rates may be increased by constructing recharge (intake) wells within percolation tanks.
Important Aspects of Percolation Tanks
 y A detailed analy sis of the rainfall pattern, number of rainy days, dry spells, evaporation rate and 
detailed hydro-geological studies are required to demarcate suitable percolation tank sites.
 y F
or India’s semi arid climate, the storage capacity of the percolation tank needs to be designed 
so that water percolates to the groundwater reservoir by January since the evaporation losses would be high subsequently.
 y P
ercolation tanks should normally be constructed on second-to-third order streams as the 
catchment as well as the submergence area would be smaller. The submergence area should be in uncultivable land as far as possible.
 y P
ercolation tanks should be located on highly fractured and weathered rock for speedy recharge. 
In case of alluvium, bouldary formations are ideal for locating percolation tanks.
 y T
he benefited area should have sufficient number of wells and cultivable land to develop the 
recharged water.
 y D
etailed hydrological studies for run off assessment should be done and design capacity should 
not normally be more than 50% of the total quantum of rainfall in the catchment.
 y W
aste weir or spillway should be suitably designed to allow the flow of surplus water based on 
single day maximum rainfall after the tank is filled to its maximum capacity.
 y Cut off trench should be provided to minimize seepage losses both below and above the stream bed. To avoid erosion of the embankment due to ripple action, stone pitching should be provided upstream up to HFL (High Flood Line).
Anicuts
An anicut is a small water harvesting masonry dam constructed across a stream to hold sufficient 
water and submerge the upstream area during the rainy season. The height of the anicut above 
ground level is about 22 feet. Anicuts are built to serve many purposes among which, recharge 
of groundwater in adjacent wells, providing water for consumption for animals, for bathing and 
providing a reservoir of water in water- scarce years, are critical. If the submerged area is large, 
bed cultivation is practis ed using the stored soil profile moisture.
107MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Anicuts are constructed all over the country and are considered very useful in those States 
where droughts are very common. Anicut construction can be undertaken on a large-scale to seek 
community participation in watershed development and make them self-reliant in water resource use.
Sub-surface Barriers
A sub-surface barrier is the most suitable artificial structure for promoting groundwater 
recharge. Since it is constructed below the riverbed on impervious subsurface strata, the structure is secure from floods, does not need elaborate overflow arrangements or periodic desilting and has limited evaporation. In addition, sub-surface structures do not require extensive areas of land for their implementation and hence have minimal ecological repercussions following their construction.
The construction of a sub-surface barrier needs a concrete or brick masonry wall, 30–60 cm wide, 
extending down to the impermeable / compact basement. A sub- surface barrier should also be constructed with angular rock pieces arranged in the form of a 100 cm wide dry masonry wall or with a 250-micron polyethylene sheeting, properly embedded in the soil. Some arrangement for sub-surface outflow from the dyke is often desirable to avoid water-logging.
Two sub-surface dykes of 100 m length each, within 300 m upstream and downstream of the 
water supply well, can capture and infiltrate enough water to service potable water requirements of a village with a population of up to 500.
Injection Wells
Injection wells are structures similar to a tube well but with the purpose of augmenting the 
groundwater storage of a confined aquifer by pumping in treated surface water under pressure. Injection wells are advantageous where land is scarce.
Hydraulically, the effective induction of water in an injection well is determined by the pumping 
rate, permeability of the aquifer, distance from the stream, natural groundwater gradient and the type of well.
In alluvial areas, an injection well for recharging a single aquifer or multiple aquifers can be 
constructed on a normal gravel packed pumping well. An injection pipe with an opening against the aquifer to be recharged may be sufficient. However, if there are a number of permeable zones separated by impervious rocks, a properly designed injection well with an inlet pipe against each aquifer to be recharged needs to be constructed. The injection wells as a means of artificial recharge are comparatively costlier and require specialized techniques of tube well construction supported by operation and maintenance to protect the recharge well from clogging.
Traditional Water Harvesting and Conservation
In India, water harvesting and conservation has been practised for a long time by local 
communities through traditional methods and structures. Different eco-regions have their own 
water harvesting and conservation structures, which the State Governments should aim to revive 
and rejuvenate through special schemes. Some of the important structures are discussed below:
108MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Dug Well Recharge
In alluvial as well as hard rocky areas, there are thousands of dug wells either gone dry or with 
declining water levels. These dug wells can be used as structures to recharge. Ground water reservoirs 
(storm water, tank water, canal water) can be diverted into these structures to directly recharge the dried / drying aquifer. By doing so the soil moisture losses during the normal process of artificial recharge are reduced.
A dry / unused well can be recharged by installing a pipe to the bottom of the dug well or below 
the water level to avoid scouring of the bottom and entrapment of air bubbles in the aquifer. The quality of source water including the silt content should be such that the quality of the groundwater in the reservoir is not deteriorated. The bottom of the dug well should be cleaned and all fine deposits should be removed before recharging. The recharge water should be silt-free. The well should be cleaned regularly and periodic chlorination should be done to prevent bacteriological contamination.
In Maharashtra, a two-pit well recharging technology has been used successfully to recharge 
dug wells. Two percolation pits are dug next to the well, one large and one small. The smaller pit 
is filled with stones, gravel and coal, which acts as a filter. A cement pipe fitted with a wire mesh 
filter is fixed at the bottom of the smaller pit. This pipe opens into the well. Rainwater that collects 
in the larger pit, flows into the smaller pit and is filtered before it flows into the well through the 
pipe. The silt that accumulates in the pits can be used in the fields. In this way, soil is conserved as 
well.
Village Pond / Tank
Village ponds / tanks are the most commonly used method to collect and store rainwater. Most 
ponds have their own catchments, which provide requisite quantity of water during the rainy season. 
Where the catchments are too small to provide enough water, water from nearby streams is diverted through open channels to fill the ponds. In some places water from irrigation canals is also used to fill ponds.
Ponds are excavated in different shapes and sizes depending on the nature of the terrain, 
availability of land and water requirements of the village community. Pond water is available for 2 months to a year after the rains, depending on the catchment characteristics and the amount and intensity of rainfall. Ponds / tanks are known by different names in different regions (Table 15).

Tankas / Kunds / Kundis
In the desert and arid areas of Rajasthan people build unique underground structures of various 
shapes and sizes to collect rainwater for drinking purposes. These structures called tankas, kunds 
or kundis are constructed in a variety of places, such as courtyards, in front of houses and temples, in open agricultural fields, barren lands. These are built both for individual households as well as for village communities using locally available materials. While some structures are built in stone masonry with stone slab coverings, others are built with only rudimentary plastering of bare soil surfaces of the tank with cement or lime and covered with Zizyphus numularia thorns. Some “kuccha” structures have a convex covering of local wood with mud plaster. Inlet holes are provided in the convex side at the ground level to facilitate entry of rainwater into the tank. In “pucca” structures (e.g. tanka) the wall of the tank is projected above the ground to provide inlet holes.
Since tankas are the main source of drinking water in these areas, people zealously protect and 
maintain them. Just before the onset of the monsoons, the catchment area of the tanka is cleaned up to remove all possible pollutants, and human activity and grazing of cattle in the area is prohibited. Even though the average annual rainfall in these areas varies from 200 mm to 300 mm with the minimum as low as 120 mm, these structures provide enough drinking water to tide over the water scarce summer months. In many, the stored water lasts for the whole year. These simple traditional water harvesting structures are useful even during years of below-normal rainfall.
Khadin
The khadin, a runoff farming and groundwater recharging system, is popular in hyper- arid 
parts of Rajasthan. Its main feature is a very long (100–300 m) earthen embankment built across the lower hill slopes lying below gravel uplands. Sluices and spillways allow excess water to drain off. The khadin system is based on the principle of harvesting rainwater on farmland and subsequent use of this water-saturated land for crop production. A khadin farm is developed based on rainfall probability, available catchment area and its runoff generation potential. Apart from the submerged area, khadin beds are cultivated from top to bottom, the line of receding moisture. Ponding of water in a khadin induces continuous groundwater recharge.
Vav / Vavdi / Baoli / Bavadi / Jhalara
These are traditional stepwells in Rajasthan and northern India. Often rectangular in design, 
these structures have steps on three or four sides.These ancient water harvesting systems collect subterranean seepage of a talab or a lake located upstream. They were mainly set up by the nobility in cities and big towns to provide water supply to the community. They were constructed at exorbitant cost and were often monumental, with fine stone work covering large areas and were associated with religion and culture.
110MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Hill Slope Collection
This system is common in many hilly areas with good rainfall (in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, 
Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh). It consists of lined channels that are built across the hill slopes to 
intercept rainwater. These channels convey water for irrigating terraced agricultural fields. The water is also used to fill small ponds for domestic use and for cattle.
Spring Water Harvesting
In the Lahaul and Spiti areas of Himachal Pradesh, water from hill streams are diverted through 
small excavated channels, called kuls, for domestic use and irrigation. In Jammu region these are called kuhals. This practice can also be seen in Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Sikkim and Darjeeling area of West Bengal. Where the springs are merely in the form of water trickling through layers and joints in rocks, split bamboo channels are used to trap and convey water up to the village / hamlet for drinking purposes.
Rainwater Harvesting in Urban Areas
Rainwater harvesting involves the collection, storage and distribution of rainwater from the roof, 
for use inside and outside the home or business. In most urban centres, rainwater harvesting has become necessary to address the acute water scarcity, which they experience and the flooding during short spells of heavy rainfall. Most of the rain falling on the surface tends to flow away rapidly leaving very little for recharge of groundwater. Capturing the runoff is therefore an important solution to the worsening urban water situation.
Rainwater harvesting has several benefits. It helps in utilizing the primary source of water, and 
prevents the runoff from going into sewers or storm drains, thereby reducing the load on treatment plants. It also reduces urban flooding and by recharging water into the aquifers, helps in improving the quality of existing groundwater through dilution.
Rainwater harvesting can be harvested from the following surfaces:
Rooftops: If buildings with impervious roofs are already in place, the catchment area is effectively 
available free of charge and can provide enough supply.
Paved and unpaved areas: Landscapes, open fields, parks, stormwater drains, roads and 
pavements and other open areas can be effectively used to harvest the runoff. The main advantage 
in using the ground as a collecting surface is that water can be collected from a larger area. This is particularly advantageous in areas with low rainfall.
Waterbodies: The potential of lakes, tanks and ponds to store rainwater is immense. The 
harvested rainwater not only meets the water requirements of the city, it also recharges groundwater aquifers.
Storm water drains: Most of the residential colonies have a proper network of stormwater 
drains. If maintained neatly, these offer a simple and cost-effective means for harvesting rainwater.
The decision on whether to store or recharge water depends on the rainfall pattern and the 
potential to do so, in a particular region. The sub-surface geology also plays an important role in making this decision.
111MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
For example, in Delhi, Rajasthan and Gujarat where the total annual rainfall occurs during 3 or 
4 months, are examples of places where groundwater recharge is usually practised. In places such 
as Kerala, Mizoram, Tamil Nadu and Bengaluru where rain falls throughout the year barring a few 
dry periods, a small-sized tank for storing rainwater is enough, since the period between two 
spells of rain is short. Wherever sub-strata are impermeable, recharging would not be feasible. 
Hence, it would be ideal to opt for storage.

Rainwater is clean and can usually be used for drinking and domestic purposes without filtering, 
depending on the cleanliness of the roof and storage system. In many cities, it is now mandatory for 
the residents to install roofwater harvesting systems with the following main features:
 y Basic 
requirements: a roof (preferably rectangular), gutters, down pipe, cement base and storage 
system. Corrugated iron or tiled roof preferable, but closely packed thatching also works (do not use asbestos). Low cost guttering systems can be made from split bamboo.
 y S
torage systems range from earthenware jars to large tanks of 30,000 litres capacity.
 y B
elow ground storage systems: generally are cheaper to construct because of the support of the 
sidewalls but they require a pump to lift the water and are more difficult to clean.
 y P
artial below ground systems: a circular hole is dug into the ground and lined with polyethylene 
or concrete plastering. It is covered with a roof (from thatch or iron sheets) to protect the water from sunlight, birds and animals.
 y A
bove ground storage: constructed from curved galvanised sheets, ferro-cement or bricks to 
form a round tank. This system does not require a pump, cleaning is easier and leaks can be detected easily. A concrete base is desirable.
Storage systems should prevent mosquitoes entering and breeding in the water, and prevent sunlight that stimulates algae growth. Easy access to all storage systems is necessary for periodic cleaning. A first flush system can be incorporated to flush away the first rainwater which has dislodged leaves and dirt after a long dry spell.
 y A
mount of water collected: A house with a 7 m x 7 m roof can capture 500 litres of water from 10 
mm of rainfall. An area with an annual rainfall of 750 mm and a 75% efficient well designed and constructed system, yields 28,000 litres per year. If an average family consumes 100 litres per day then there is enough water for 280 days (assuming there is sufficient storage).
Water Saving Technologies: Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation Systems
State Governments are encouraging adoption of water-saving technologies, such as sprinkler 
and drip irrigation systems, through provision of subsidies to the farmers on the purchase of these systems. These technologies are recommended for achieving higher irrigation efficiencies and could be used for very small-sized holdings.
While sprinklers require energized pump sets, microtube drips can work under a very low-
pressure head, with as little as a bucket full of water. Sprinklers tend to irrigate more uniformly than gravity systems and therefore efficiencies typically average about 70%. But in windy and dry areas 
112MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
much water can be lost due to evaporation in this system. The sprinkler system is particularly effective 
in sandy undulating terrain. For fruits, vegetables and orchard crops, drip irrigation (also known as trickle irrigation) is more suitable.
These systems require  much less  maintenance when  compared with the conventional 
pressurized irrigation systems.The ease of maintenance is more significant in microtube drip systems. However, the adoption of these technologies by poor farmers would depend heavily on the supply of information, materials and services for installation.
Improved Water Saving Farm Practices
It is necessary to adopt farm practices which can progressively reduce the water requirement of 
existing crops and improve primary productivity of the cultivated land. Such practices are particularly important for semi-arid regions which have already taken to intensive farming with irrigation water, both from canals and aquifers. These practices include the increased use of organic manure with the gradual reduction of chemical fertilizers, vermin-culture and agronomic practices, such as mulching, crop rotation and the use of biopest control measures. Organic manure can help regain structure and texture of soils and enhance their moisture retention capacity along with improving soil nutrients. Use of farm management practices, such as mulching, can reduce evaporation from the soil surface, thereby increasing the efficiency of irrigation water utilization.
Long-term Irrigation Management
A long-term strategy is required for managing water resources through irrigation projects in 
India. It consists of several measures which would expand the area under irrigation and reduce the incidence of drought. All State Governments need to develop policies and procedures for utilization of irrigation resources. The State irrigation department should formulate long-term policies and management practices for the use of irrigation resources. The important elements of these policies and management practices are listed below:
Monitoring Reservoirs: It is necessary for the State irrigation department to set up a monitoring 
system for water stored in reservoirs, exercise appropriate control on releases of water from these 
reservoirs and plan for judicious use of water resources. The State irrigation department should 
prepare a water budget for every reservoir covering drinking water, kharif / rabi requirements and 
evaporation losses. Many details of reservoir management have been discussed in the chapter 
on water resource management in the previous c hapter.
Setting up Water Users Association: State Governments should provide incentives for 
setting up Water Users Association (WUA) to involve communities in the management of irrigation 
resources. WUAs should be formed at the minor canal level (average command of 500 hectares). The responsibility for maintaining the minor and smaller channels can be entrusted with the WUAs. The State irrigation department should charge WUAs on the basis of the volume of water actually taken. Incentives for setting up WUAs could be provided to the farmers by relaxing designated crop restrictions and restrictions on conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, channel repairs, rebates for prompt payment of irrigation fees, volumetric fees lower than crop-area fees and maintenance grants.
113MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Conjunctive Use of Surface and Groundwater: This concept is very essential, especially in 
drought areas to increase the production per unit of water. It allows flexibility in cropping patterns 
and multi-cropping in the canal command. For proper water management it is necessary to treat the command areas as one composite unit and the two resources managed judiciously to achieve optimal benefits. This concept use has been successfully implemented in various States. Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater supplies needs careful planning on more scientific lines to achieve full benefits.
Prevention of Evaporation Losses from Reservoirs: Shallow tanks having large surface areas 
located in the drought-affected regions lose nearly half the volume of stored water by evaporation during the summer months. The evaporation is quite high (250 cm or more) in West Rajasthan, Saurashtra, Deccan Plateau and Southern Coastal regions of Tamil Nadu. In these areas use of a chemical retardant to minimize evaporation losses may be economically viable. A layer of chemicals like cetyl, steary and fatty alcohol emulsions when applied on the water surface can help reduce evaporation. It has been reported that fatty alcohol emulsions can effectively retard evaporation, saving around 40% of the normal evaporation losses. However, such measures may be considered after suitable bio-degradability study and bio-hazard assessment, and after necessary approvals from pollution control and other regulatory authorities.
Increasing Storages through Expeditious Completion of Irrigation Projects: Water storage 
capacity in the States could be increased through expeditious completion of irrigation projects. Many States that started a large number of irrigation projects, could not complete them due to inadequate resources. States should seek resources through the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) of the Government of India for completing these projects and increasing the area under irrigation.
 Integrating Small Reservoirs with Major Reservoirs: As large dams are difficult to construct 
due to high costs and large-scale displacement of people, there is an increased emphasis on creating small reservoirs. A number of small reservoirs could be created to replace a single large reservoir. However, in many cases a group of small schemes may not provide the same benefits as a large project can. It is, therefore, very important that minor schemes are integrated with the canal systems of major reservoirs.
Integrated Basin Planning: This concept is aimed at coordinating water resources plans 
throughout a river basin, the most important example of which is the Tennessee Valley Authority in the USA. In India, the Damodar Valley Corporation covering the river Damodar and its tributaries in Bihar and West Bengal was modeled on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
The philosophy of river basin development, however, underwent significant changes during the 
latter half of the twentieth century. In 1950, the construction of multiple-purpose dams and other engineering works along a river’s main channel was central to the concept. The region benefited through navigation, flood control, hydropower generation and distribution, and agricultural development. By the end of the century, however, the concept shifted and broadened and laid emphasis on the values of biodiversity, nonstructural means of improved water management and stakeholder participation in watershed-level initiatives. All States need to adopt integrated basin planning for addressing wide-ranging issues of natural resource management.
Inter-basin Transfer of Water: The permanent long-term solution to the drought problem 
may be found in the basic principles of transfer of power from surplus river basins to the areas of 
114MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
deficit. Many basins in the country have surplus water resources while others face serious shortages. 
Creation of storages and inter-basin transfer of water from surplus to deficit regions could therefore be an option for achieving more equitable distribution and optimal utilization of water resources. It has been argued that a National Water Grid could be set up by linking resource abundant rivers such as the Brahmaputra and Ganga with other rivers. Long distance water transfer is not a new concept in India. There are a number of canals, such as the Western Yamuna Canal and Agra Canal in north India, and the Kurnool–Cuddapah Canal and the Periyar–Vaigai Canal in south India, which have carried water for long distances and irrigated water deficient areas. However, these projects would require huge commitment of resources as well as popular support across the States, and would call for extensive studies related to environment impact and benefit-cost analyses.
Afforestation
It is well-known that the development of forests in areas, which are susceptible to periodic 
recurrence of drought, is indeed a very effective drought-resistant measure. Areas which are devoid of tree growth suffer serious erosion and need to be covered with vegetation in the shortest possible time with a view to mitigate drought conditions.
Drought-affected areas have vast expanses devoid of vegetation, depleted of tree growth and 
exposed parent rocks and boulders. The accelerated run-off in these areas is so large that all the surrounding agricultural land cannot even support marginal or subsistence agriculture. To remedy this, vegetation on hill slopes, catchments and other vulnerable areas need to be undertaken, particularly where rainfall is low. Plantation and green cover may be encouraged to help check soil erosion and the use of organic compost and bio-degradable mulching will enable the absorption and retainment of minerals for long time  thereby reducing the risk of leaching.
Trees and vegetation not only protect the soil, improve its water holding capacity, minimize run-
off, regulate drainage (both surface and underground), but also preserve and improve the productive capacity of the soil and fertility of agricultural land in the vicinity. The foliage produced any effective vegetation, whether trees, shrubs, bushes or even well-pastured grass, forms a sheltering shield or canopy which breaks down the intensity of torrential rain and thus reduces its erosive action on the soil. Furthermore, when this water with reduced velocity reaches down, it does not flow down to the rivers but is absorbed due to the vegetation and helps recharge ground and surface water resulting in the creation of perennial rather than seasonal storage in the reservoirs. Therefore, multi-tier plantation of grasses, bushes, shrubs and trees of local multipurpose varieties should be promoted as these are more tolerant to temperature / climatic conditions.
Before the afforestation programme is taken up, a thorough inspection and classification of 
the areas needs to be conducted. The land identified for afforestation should be divided into three categories: (i) areas with adequate depth of soil to make afforestation feasible; (ii) areas with shallow soils fit for supporting grass and shrub growth but not fit for tree growth; (iii) badly degraded and eroded areas unfit for tree growth and shrubs and where only soil and moisture conservation operations should be carried out.
In drought-prone areas, planting of drought-resistant varieties of trees should be considered. 
Fruit trees, such as sitafal (annona squamosa) and drought-resistant fodder species, may not only be useful as an afforestation measure, but also enable the supply of fodder to the cattle. Different 
115MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
species of bushes and shrubs should be planted, which not only prevent soil erosion but also provide 
a leaf-hedge against cattle and barrier against fire when planted like a boundary or fence.
Afforestation should be financially supported through the social forestry and watershed 
development programmes which normally carry budgetary provisions for this activity. Assistance from the Sub-Mission on Agro-forestry will help to promote peripheral boundary plantation, low density block plantation and high density block plantation.  Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) can play a critical role in the expansion and sustainability of activities.
Crop insurance 
Farmers from drought risk regions may be encouraged to subscribe to the crop insurance for 
reducing the risk. Awareness building programmes may be undertaken to increase the farmer participation in the crop insurance.          
Community Participation in Drought Mitigation
Community participation is an essential feature of drought mitigation programmes. As local 
water management and rainwater harvesting hold the key to drought mitigation, Government 
policies should emphasize community-based water resource management. Community-based 
institutions, such as WUAs, can play important roles in managing water resources at the micro 
level. The Prime Minister 's Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) and Pilot Unified Package Insurance Scheme 
may be promoted vigorously in drought affected districts
Build on Micro-level Experiences: The villages of Sukhomajri in Haryana and about 100 
communities in Alwar have improved their socio-economic conditions through community-led 
water management. These communities used traditional water harvesting structures, such as village tanks and johads, which increased the groundwater table in the area, resulting in increased water storage and substantial increase in crop production and resultant income. Ralegan Siddhi and Hirve bazar from Ahmednagar district are the other successful examples of community-based initiatives in water resource management. These micro-level success stories need to be spread to other parts of the country for other communities to replicate.
Innovate Community-based Institutions: Several models of community-based 
institutions have emerged, which are effectively managing surface and groundwater. In 
Odisha , the ‘Pani Panchayat programme’ assigns various roles to the community and the 
local self-government in water management and is preparing community-based drought 
management plans. In Ozhar, Maharashtra WUAs are enabling farmers to manage irrigation 
water. In Banikhet, Himachal Pradesh the lift irrigation project deals with various aspects of 
water use, such as water charges, local maintenance. In Rajasthan, communities are 
participating in checks on rainwater loss and thus ensuring the enhancement of groundwater. 
State Governments need to build on these examples and encourage the formation of community-
based organizations for effective management of water resources.
As discussed above, State Governments need to encourage the formation of WUAs for community-
based management of water delivery system. Maharashtra has taken the lead in 1990 in forming WUAs, and its State Government has handed over the management of the entire irrigation systems of Niphad block, where the irrigation dam is situated, to the WUA network. WUA-like initiatives have 
116MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
been launched in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, which also 
suffer from water scarcity. Legislations dealing with transferring of water management to WUA- like groups are being formulated in all these States.
Organize Community-based Consultations through Gram Sabha: Community-based 
consultations refer to community decisions, collective contribution, self- regulations, and negotiations with the Government conducted through Gram Sabhas, in particular and PRIs in general. These processes can be very important for the management of water, fodder and crops at the community-level. Further, these processes can also lead to meeting the basic entitlements through provision of work and food to people affected by drought.
Strengthen Women’s Self-help Groups: Self-help groups empower women and help them to 
access resources. Women start economic activities and generate an independent stream of income. While it has an empowering impact on women, it also increases resilience of the households in responding to drought. Those households who depend solely on agriculture for their livelihoods suffer badly due to income and consumption losses, while diversified households cope with the impact better. These self-help groups could be formed and strengthened through many interventions at the community level.
Women’s self-help groups can play an important role in a large number of measures targeted at 
drought mitigation. They could be involved in rainwater harvesting, running PDS shops, Aanganwadis and day care centres and overseeing water distribution and utilization in their community. Since women are the most affected in a drought situation, they could plan several measures that reduce their hardships and promote greater equity and efficiency in natural resource management. Women’s self-help groups could also come forward in addressing special needs of certain groups, such as pregnant women, school-going children and the old and disabled people. During a drought situation, the well being of these groups can only be ensured through the active support of women’s groups.
 Empower Panchayati Raj Institutions: Several drought relief and mitigation measures 
could be implemented through the PRIs more effectively. The necessary budget allocations and implementation support should be provided to these institutions for launching programmes in drought-affected areas. PRIs improve the delivery mechanism and reduce the impact of drought. The examples of several droughts have shown the importance of involving these institutions in drought management.
Climate Variability and Adaptation
Climate variability refers to the climatic parameter of a region varying from its long- term mean. 
Every year in a specific time period, the climate of a location is different. Some years have below average rainfall, some have average or above average rainfall. Due to the phenomenon of climate change affecting India, such variability would have an impact on agriculture. As a result of variability, the hydrological cycle is likely to be altered and the severity of droughts and intensity of floods in various parts of India is likely to increase. Further, a general reduction in the quantity of available run-off is predicted. Simulations using dynamic crop models indicate a decrease in yield of crops as temperature increases in different parts of India.
117MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Incidence of pests and diseases may increase with climate variability and climate change. With 
long dry spells and more intense rainfall, the resulting decline in water quality will lead to greater 
risk of water-borne diseases. Changing temperatures and rainfall in drought-prone areas are likely to shift populations of insect pests and other vectors and change the incidence of existing vector-borne diseases in both humans and crops.
Livelihood activities that rely on sensitive agricultural systems will be more vulnerable to climate 
change. Trends such as population growth, pollution, increasing demand for food and water and market fluctuations can compound the impact of climate variability and climate change.
Adaptation to climate variability is a process of practising the cultivation methods to 
moderate, cope with or take advantage of the consequences of climatic events.
Adaptation options need to benefit the community and ensure community participation so that 
experiences of local-level adaptation strategies can be shared. To implement adaptation measures in the agriculture sector, it is necessary to understand the potential impacts of climate change and local perceptions. The basic understanding in the context of climate change adaptation in drought-prone areas is that the adaptation option should have the potential to improve the livelihood assets (human, natural, financial, physical and social) of rural people.
Through efforts to determine the viability of adaptation options, it is actually possible to create 
a menu of adaptation options for the development planning process with the potential to be 
integrated into the existing institutional agenda. Short-term cropping, inter-cropping, small-scale 
fodder cultivation, small-scale fish cultivation in mini-ponds, homestead gardens and farm ponds for 
rainwater harvesting are some of the examples of adaptation practices that can be adopted at the 
local level. These livelihood practices, which improve the adaptive capacity of the farmers, are 
likely to be a regular feature of the drought management programme.
Power supply in vulnerable area
States may take necessary actions to ensure quality power supply in the areas vulnerable 
drought. Structural measures for power distribution need to be implemented in a systematic manner.
Public Distribution S ystem (PDS)
The Public Distribution supply chain and Fair Price Shops should be fully geared to deal with a 
drought situation. The State Government/District Administration should carry out regular inspections 
to ensure that distribution of ration is not hampered in any way.  
Crop management practices 
Cultivation of drought resistant crops and crop varieties followed by scientific management 
practices would lead to drought proofing over a period of time. The State departments should encourage farmers adopt better crop management practices from time to time.
Indigenous knowledge
Traditional knowledge and local practices need to be fully exploited and implemented to 
increase the drought resistance.
118MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
Documentation of best practices
The best practices in drought mitigation implemented in different parts of the State need 
to documented and showcased to all the stakeholders in order to achieve large scale use of 
such practices.
Awareness and Capacity building
Campaigns to build awareness on drought mitigation methods and programmes to build 
the capacities of farmers and village level functionaries would be of immense use for efficient 
implementation of different measures of drought proofing.
Monitoring of Drought Mitigation
The State Government /State Executive Committee (SEC) may consider periodic review of 
the progress of drought mitigation activities of different departments. The SEC should cause the formulation of holistic drought mitigation plans at least for vulnerable districts, if not for sub divisions/Mandals etc. Such plans will help sharpen the focus on mitigation measures and gain from the synergies being brought in by line departments. 
Drought Vulnerability and  Risk mapping
Drought vulnerability and risk maps are useful to prioritize the areas for convergence of drought 
mitigation measures. 
Vulnerability assessment studies should examine livelihood patterns, impact on income and 
consumption, social capital, migration and social security system, which in fluence t he vulnerability 
of people. Such an assessment would be necessary to suggest measures for watershed management, 
irrigation e fficiency, ap propriate ag ricultural pr actices an d cr opping ch oices pa ttern, wa ter 
conservation etc., new risk management measures. NRSC (ISRO) has developed agricultural 
drought vulnerability assessment methodology by including weather, soil, crop and socio-
econom ic indicators and generated sub-district level vulnerability maps for Andhra Pradesh, 
Telangana and Haryana states.  The study reports are available at www.nrsc.gov.in. The States 
may take the assistance of Scientific institutions in the mapping of drought vulnerability and risks. 
However, to begin with, the districts having encountered large number of droughts in the past 15 
years can be justifiably selected for vulnerability assessment.

120MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
The mission / task force should also prioritize programmes that include the completion of 
unfinished irrigation and watershed development projects, ground and surface water and 
regulatory framework for improved use conservation of natural resources for reducing the 
drought risk. 
Decision Support System for Drought Management
Development of a decision support system for drought management would streamline the 
implementation of the drought mitigation activities. Establishing automated weather stations 
and rain gauges to improve the collection of information, promote the use of data related to soil, vegetation and water resource obtained through remote sensing technology and actively support research on climate and natural resource management are some of the initiatives to strengthen the drought mitigation endeavours. Such information provides more analytical tools for understanding drought and making informed policy choices for drought mitigation.
 States may network with all the established research institutions at the national level dealing 
with remote sensing satellite data, dryland agriculture and natural resource management to acquire necessary technical expertise for handing drought mitigation measures. 
Impact Assessment and evaluation 
Drought mitigation measures have been in existence for a long time, but the complexity and 
dynamics of the calamity are equally daunting. 
States should therefore consider evolving mechanisms for monitoring and impact assessment 
of drought mitigation programmes/activities. It is suggested to take up household survey  with 
properly designed questionnaire to capture the effectiveness  of drought mitigation measures. 
The impact assessment and evaluation of response system is suggested to be taken up at regular 
intervals.
Promote Education and Awareness of Mitigation Policies and Measures
Encourage education and awareness programmes on drought mitigation issues. People must 
be informed of the importance of water conservation and harvesting, optimal water use and the need for increasing forest cover. A wide public awareness about the importance of natural resource management is a very important aspect of a long-term drought mitigation programme.
Bring together policymakers and scientific experts for developing feasible and practical public 
policies and encourage academic research on the key indicators of drought.  It should be extremely helpful if academic institutions are asked to participate actively in drought mitigation programmes.
Encourage Community-level Plans for Drought Mitigation
The States should consider involving community institutions actively in drought mitigation and 
to build public awareness. 
The States should provide necessary policy, programme, and financial support to the PRIs for 
drought mitigation. A large number of programmes are being implemented through the PRIs and it is necessary that these institutions are sensitive to the drought mitigation issues. Though the PRIs are generally very active in monitoring local interventions, there is a need for greater sensitization of the drought risks. 
121MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
All over the country, self-help groups are being set up, seeking the participation of women in 
large numbers. Women bear a disproportionate share of the consequences of drought and, therefore, 
it would be fruitful to initiate an active dialogue with women Self Help Groups (SHGs) on drought mitigation strategy based on conservation and optimal use of water. The mission / task force should consider encouraging self-help groups to take up drought mitigation programs and for that these groups should be allowed access to resources, knowledge and information.
The States should consider involving NGOs and community-based organizations in implementing 
the drought mitigation strategy. Several Government programmes in soil and water conservation and water supply are being implemented through NGOs. The mission / task force should recommend implementing these programmes in a more integrated manner for effective drought mitigation.

Annex 2 : Drought Monitoring Centres Mandate and Organization
Background
At present, the Ministries / Departments responsible for drought management at the National 
and State levels get inadequate technical support for drought early warning and monitoring. It has a 
serious impact on the timelines and scale of operations for drought management.
The Government of Karnataka set up a Drought Monitoring Cell in the year 1988. This institution 
has taken a lead in monitoring and managing the recurring drought situation in the State on a scientific basis. Drought Monitoring Cell is thus considered to be a success in terms of knowledge management and decision support system. 
The Drought Monitoring Centre (DMC) would monitor all the indices and indicators of drought 
on a scientific basis and provide technical advice to the Government. It would interact with multiple National and State-level scientific institutions, Ministries and Departments, obtain relevant information related to different aspects of drought, and assist the Government in the management of drought relief and mitigation.
Objectives
The objectives of DMC at the National and State levels are as follows:
a. T o act as the scientific and technical advisor to the Government on all aspects of drought 
management;
b. T o undertake studies and research on various scientific and technical issues related to drought management;
c. T o develop a database on various drought related indices and indicators; precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, surface water bodies, land
 use, soils and forest cover;
d. T o provide drought early warning information to the Government and other stakeholders;
e. T o develop short-term and long-term drought mitigation measures and recommend them to the various institutions and farmers;
f. T o develop a network of various resources and user agencies so that the information and  database management could be strengthened through collective inputs of these agencies; and
g. T o initiate, support and coordinate applied research programs in universities and other institutions related to drought monitoring and mitigation.
Activities
DMC would conduct a number of core activities in relation to drought management. These core 
activities are as follows:
(i) Build and Maintain a Database on Drought Indices and Indicators: DMC would
 regularly 
collect and analyze data of various indicators of drought such as rainfall,  land use patterns, 
agricultural conditions, groundwater and surface water levels,  and socio-economic conditions 
143MANUAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT
such as migration, distress sale of assets, etc. Such a database would be maintained on GIS 
platforms, and be accessible to all the users.
(ii) Preparation and Issuance of Periodical Reports on Drought: DMC would prepare and disseminate reports prepared on daily, weekly , monthly, seasonally, and annual
 basis on different 
aspects of drought management. It would include reports on rainfall, various stages of agricultural operations, crop conditions, reservoir levels,
 fodder, and drinking water situations.
(iii) Inter-disciplinary Studies on Drought Management: DMC would support inter- disciplinary studies on drought management to develop a knowledge-based public
 policy on drought 
management. It would combine aspects of climate change, meteorology, agriculture, irrigation, water conservation, and coping strategies adopted by the people. Such studies would provide insights into natural resource management, and suggest feasible mitigation measures.
(iv) Maintenance and Operation of a Weather Stations Network: DMC may consider setting up telemetric rain gauges / weather stations in the state, maintaining the network, and improving the database on climate and rainfall.
DMC’ s subsidiary activities are described as follows:
(i) Satellite-based drought monitoring in collaboration with National Remote Sensing Centre 
(NRSC), Hyderabad through obtaining vegetation index
(ii) Crop yield estimation in collaboration with Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and other agriculture-related institutions
(iii) Water balance studies and preparation of Moisture Adequacy Index (MAI)
(iv) Crop water budgeting studies for the districts and T alukas / T ehsils / blocks, crop- wise
(v) Impact assessment of watershed development programs
(vi) Standardization of average rainfall for all the T alukas / T ehsils / blocks and districts
(vii) Assist the Government in the processes leading to the declaration of drought
(viii) Assist the Government in preparation of loss estimates due to drought and preparation of Memorandum for submission to the Government of India
(ix) Documentation of drought management efforts
(x) Advise the Government on different aspects of water and soil management
Organizational Set up
The State DMC should be headed by the Relief Commissioner and have a complement of 
technical experts related to agriculture, meteorology, remote sensing, hydrology and related fields on a permanent or deputation/ contractual basis.  It should have a well defined office with appropriate staff and equipment.

Annex 4: Preparation of Memorandum to Government of India for 
Assistance from the NDRF (National Disaster Response Fund)
State Governments submit Memorandum to the Central Government, in Ministry of Agriculture 
and Farmers Welfare, seeking assistance for drought relief from the National Disaster Response Fund 
(NDRF). The Memorandum is submitted after the State Government formally declares drought.
It is recommended that the Memorandum is precise containing all relevant details related to 
intra-seasonal variation in rainfall, crop condition, food-grain prices, availability of fodder, water crisis, fire incidences, migration, sale of assets, withdrawal of children from schools, etc. and details of relief employment, provision and distribution of foodgrains, supply of drinking water, cattle camps and fodder depots, and any other relief measure organized by the State Government and other organizations, along with expenditures incurred by the State Government.
The Memorandum will clearly specify if the drought is of the ‘Severe’ category and for assistance 
shall mandatorily be accompanied by details of the key indicators of drought as specified in Table 3.11 and village-wise field verification data table as referred to in 3.5.1 in Chapter 3 in the National Drought Management Manual. 
The second part of Memorandum may provide details. The section may also provide information 
on other indicators of drought: 
The Memorandum should provide the details of assistance requested from the NDRF. Such a 
request needs to be framed necessarily in accordance with the guidelines prescribed for the NDRF and supported by necessary details.  Information on the expenditures incurred through the SDRF, and the balances available with the SDRF should also be mentioned.  Request should not be made for items  not covered under the extant norms.

1.1 The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) came into existence as 
an independent Ministry on 15 October 1999 after the merger of the Department of Statistics and the  
Department of Programme Implementation. The Ministry is the nodal agency for planned and  
organized development of the statistical system in the country and coordination of statistical activities 
among different stakeholders in Government of India, State Governments, Union Territories as well as meeting requirements of the International Agencies. 
1.2
 The Ministry has two wings viz. the Statistics Wing and the Programme Implementation (PI) 
Wing. There is one Autonomous Body known as the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which is an  
institute of national importance by an Act of Parliament, viz. The Indian Statistical Institute Act 1959, 
which is a renowned and premier institute in the field of Statistics in the country. In addition, there is a National Statistical Commission (NSC), which was created through a Resolution of Government of India with effect from 12 July 2006 with a mandate to evolve policies, priorities and standards in statistical matters. The organisation chart of the Ministry is at Annexure IA and IB.
1.3
 MoSPI is the nodal Ministry of the Government of India for all statistical matters and  
attaches considerable importance to coverage and quality aspects of statistics released in the  
country. MoSPI uses technology to achieve the same. The statistics released by the Ministry are based 
on administrative sources, surveys and censuses conducted by the Central and State Governments and non-official sources and studies. The surveys conducted by the Ministry are based on scientific  
sampling methods. Data is collected through dedicated field staff who are regularly trained in the concepts and definitions of the items and the scope of the survey. In line with the  
emphasis on the quality of statistics released by the Ministry, the methodological issues concerning the  
compilation of national accounts are over seen by an Advisory Committee on National Accounts, industrial statistics by a Standing Committee on Industrial Statistics and price and cost of living  
indices by a Technical Advisory Committee on Statistics of Price and Cost of Living (TAC on SPCL). The Ministry compiles data-sets based on current data, after applying standard statistical  
techniques and extensive scrutiny and supervision.
1.4
 The Statistics Wing, called National Statistical Office (NSO) coordinates the statistical  
activities in the country and is responsible for evolving and laying down statistical standards.  
India is a subscriber to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Special Data Dissemination  
Standards (SDDS) and is currently fulfilling the Standards. The Ministry maintains an ‘Advance Releas  
Calendar’ for its data categories covered under the SDDS, which is disseminated on the  
Ministry’s website as well as on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) of the IMF.  
The Ministry releases the datasets covered under the Real Sector of SDDS through press notes and  
its website simultaneously. India has a strong system of official statistics and is among the  Chapter 1
Introduction

leading countries in the area of official statistics. The Ministry’s officials have been associated  
with international agencies on the development of methodologies, particularly in the areas of  
national accounts, informal sector statistics, large-scale sample surveys, conduct of censuses,  
service sector statistics, non-observed economy, social sector statistics, environmental statistics and  
classifications, statistical compilations and international practices. The contribution of  
the Ministry’s officials in international meetings on these subjects has been highly appreciated.
1.5  Recently, it has been decided that:
 i) The nomenclature of Data Quality Assurance Division (DQAD) and Data Informatics  
  Innovation Division (DIID) stands reverted back to Data Processing Division (DPD  
   and Computer Centre respectively, with their original roles and responsibilities. 
 ii)  As per earlier situation, Computer Centre and Central Statistics Office (CSO) to  
  continue to function as the attached offices of the Ministry, with their original  
  roles and responsibilities. 
 iii) National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and its constituents viz.  Survey  Coordination   
  Division  (SCD), Data Processing Division (DPD), Survey Designand Research  
  Division (SDRD) and Field Operations Division (FOD) to continue to function as  
  Subordinate Offices of the Ministry, with their original roles a nd responsibilities.
1.6 The Programme Implementation (PI) Wing has two Divisions, namely (i) Members of  
Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) and (ii) Infrastructure and Project  
Monitoring Division (IPMD). The MPLAD Scheme is a Central Sector Scheme, fully funded by 
the Government of India, which was announced on 23 December 1993 by the then Prime Minister of India in the Parliament. Hon’ble Members of Parliament are allocated annual authorization of 
$5 
crore at the beginning of each financial year subject to certain conditions. The main objective of the Scheme is to enable each Member of Parliament to recommend works of developmental nature with  
emphasis on the creation of durable community assets based on the locally felt needs of the people.  
The Infrastructure Projects Monitoring Division (IPMD) undertakes the monitoring of projects above 
$150 crore. 
1.7 The National Accounts Division (NAD) of the Central Statistics Office (CSO), MoSPI is  
responsible for preparation of national accounts, which include the estimates of Gross Domestic  
Product (GDP), National Income, Government/Private Final Consumption Expenditure, Capital  
Formation and Saving along with details of transactions of institutional sectors. NAD  
annually brings out a publication titled ‘National Accounts Statistics’, containing these statistics. NAD  
releases annual and quarterly estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from time to time as per  
pre-specified schedule given in Advance Release Calendar. As per second Advance Estimate (SAE) of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for FY 2023-24 released on February 29, 2024 the growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during 2023- 24 was estimated at 7.6 per cent as compared to the 
2
growth rate of 7.0 per cent in 2022-23. Real Gross Value Added (GV A) at Basic Prices is estimated at 
$158.28 lakh crore in 2023-24, as against $148.05 lakh crore in 2022-23, showing the growth of 6.9 
per cent.
1.8 The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is designed to measure the changes over time in  
general level of retail prices of selected goods and services that household purchase for 
the purpose of consumption. CPI numbers are widely used as macroeconomic indicator of  
inflation, and also as a tool by government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for targeting  
inflation and monitoring price stability. CPI is also used as deflator in the National Accounts. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses CPI, released by MoSPI, as measure of inflation for its bimonthly monetary policy announcement. MoSPI released Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Base 2012=100 for All India Rural, Urban and Combined for the month of March, 2024 which were 187.8, 183.6 and 185.8, showing an annual inflation rate of 5.51%, 4.14% and 4.85% respectively. All-India  
Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) for the month of March, 2024 for Rural, Urban and  
Combined were 187.8, 193.4 and 189.8 respectively. All India year-on-year inflation rates for CFPI for the month of March, 2024 for Rural, Urban and Combined sector were 8.55%, 8.41% and 8.52%  
respectively. The NSO, MoSPI releases data on Inflation and CPI on 12th of every month (on next working day, in case of 12th being a holiday). Therefore, time lag in release of this data is only 12 days. The release contains State-wise comprehensive inflation figures for the usage of various stakeholders.
1.9
 International Comparison Programme (ICP) is the largest statistical initiative in the world 
under the aegis of United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). The World Bank is implementing 
this programme at global level and Asian Development Bank is the nodal implementing agency at Asia and the Pacific Region. The main objectives of ICP are to produce Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) and Price Level Indices and to convert volume and per capita measures of GDP into common  
currencies using PPPs. India has been participating in ICP since 1970 and MoSPI is the nodal implementing agency to represent India in this programme. The Price Statistics Division (PSD)  
of National Statistical Office, MoSPI is responsible for providing data to ADB for inter-country  
validations and compilation of PPP etc. The data for ICP is collected from different sources  
including Field Operations Division (FOD) of MoSPI, Administrative Data, Surveys and Other  
Sources available with various ministries. At present, ICP 2021 round is going on and the results are about to release soon.
1.10
 The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) with the base year 2011-12 is compiled and published 
by the Economic Statistics Division (ESD) of MoSPI on the 12th of every month (or the previous  
working day if the 12th is a holiday) with a time lag of six weeks from the reference month. The IIP 
covers three sectors namely Mining, Manufacturing, and Electricity. The IIP for 2023-24 stands at 146.7, registering growth of 5.9 percent against 5.2 percent of 2022-23.

National Statistical Commission (NSC)
7
3.1 National Statistical Office (NSO) coordinates the statistical activities in the country and is  
responsible for evolving and laying down statistical standards. Its activities inter alia include  
compilation of National Accounts, Index of Industrial Production, Consumer Price Indices for  
Urban/Rural/ Combined, Human Development Statistics including Gender Statistics and Economic 
Census and imparting training in Official Statistics and National Sample Survey activities through a subordinate office of this Ministry namely, Field Operations Division (FOD). NSO also assists in  
development of statistics in the States and Union Territories and disseminates Energy Statistics, Social and Environmental Statistics and prepares the National Industrial Classification.
3.2
 NSO has an important role in the context of multi-domain statistics like gender, education, 
health, food security etc. and plays the critical role of setting up collaborations across the different agencies of the government, so that the efforts of each of these agencies could be accumulated to  
efficiently produce timely statistics that reflect the different aspects of these economically and socially relevant phenomna in the country. One of the roles that the NSO assumes is that of an  
aggregator of information of these multi-domain statistics, so that the policy makers and users have all the necessary information in one place. The function of this consolidated dataset is to provide basic information for decision making, evaluations and assessments at all levels. In this regard, the Social Statistics Division, on behalf of NSO, produces certain annual publications as also subject-specific  
ad-hoc publications, which are usually the outcome of certain user demands.
3.3
 The Divisions represents the NSO in several expert/technical groups and comitees formed 
in the various Ministries and Departments both at the Centre and State levels and plays a key role in 
not just ensuring coordination among the different statistical agencies within the country, but also in  
emphasizing the use of standardized concepts, classifications andmethods to promote the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all levels. Various divisions in NSO play the crucial role of  
developing capacities across the different agencies so as to improve the robustness and coverage of the existing indicator-set in respect of multi-domain statistics.

Price Statistics
3.18 The National Statistical Office (NSO), MoSPI started compiling Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
separately for rural, urban, and combined sectors on monthly basis with Base Year (2010=100) for 
all India and States/UTs with effect from January 2011. It revised the Base Year of the CPI from 2010=100 to 2012=100, incorporating methodological improvements in consonance with the  
international practices.  The basket of items and weighing diagrams for the revised series have been prepared using the Modified Mixed Reference Period (MMRP) data of the Consumer  
Expenditure Survey (CES), 2011-12 of the 68th Round of National Sample Survey (NSS). In addition, Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) is also being released as weighted average of the indices of ten  
subgroups: ‘Cereals and products’; ‘Meat and fish’; ‘Egg’; ‘Milk and products’; ‘Oils and fats’; ‘Fruits’; ‘Vegetables’; ‘Pulses and products’; ‘Sugar and confectionery’; and ‘Spices’. CFPI does not include  
‘Non-alcoholic beverages’ and ‘Prepared meals, snacks, sweets etc.’
Trends in CPI based inflation
3.19 All India year-on-year inflation rates (Percentage change of CPI of current month over  
corresponding month of last year), based on CPI for combined sector, was above 4 per cent during 
December 2022 to March 2024. The said rate was highest in July 2023 at 7.44 per cent. The minimum 
rate was registered at 4.31 per cent in May 2023 during the aforementioned period. 
3.20 All India year-on-year inflation rates (%) based on CFPI for the combined sector shows 
that average inflation rate of food items during December 2022 to March 2024 was 6.92 %. CFPI 
inflation touched its highest level at 11.51 per cent  in July 2023, and lowest 2.96 per cent in May 2023.

and sub-group levels. It is to be stated that ‘Food and beverages’ as a whole has 45.86 per cent share, 
which includes 39.05 per cent share of CFPI in CPI basket of combined sector. Therefore, food items are generally the major drivers of overall inflation rate based on CPI.  Sub-group/Group wise  
inflation rates and their respective shares (in terms of weight) have been combined together to know their contribution to overall inflation rate during each month from December 2022 to March 2024. These contributions are given in the table below:

Index of Industrial Production (IIP)
3.22 The all-India Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is a short-term composite indicator that  
measures changes in the volume of production of a basket of industrial products with respect to a base 
period. The Economic Statistics Division (ESD) of MoSPI compiles IIP using secondary data received from 14 source agencies in various Ministries/ Departments or their attached/subordinate offices.  
Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is the major source agency.
3.23
 IIP is released every month in the form of Quick Estimates with a time lag of 6 weeks as 
per the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) norms of IMF. Apart from the breakup of the  
index for mining, manufacturing, and electricity sectors, the estimates are also simultaneously  
being released as per NIC 2-digit categories and Use- based classification (UBC) viz., Primary Goods,  
Capital Goods,Intermediate Goods, Infrastructure/Construction goods, Consumer durables and 
Consumer non-durables. The press releases, indices and growth rates at sectoral, NIC  
2-digit level and UBC categories, indices and production at item group level, metadata, and  
details of methodology of all India IIP with the base year 2011-12 are made available in the  
website (https://www.mospi.gov.in/iip - 2011-12-series) for public access.

169 associated targets highlighting the focus areas necessary to achieve sustainable development 
by 2030. At the heart of the SDGs, there are five critical dimensions - people, prosperity, planet,  
partnership and peace, each of which are addressed in the 2030 Agenda by using the universally  
applicable SDGs and targets covering the three aspects of sustainable development viz.,  
Economic, Social and Environmental. To monitor the progress of SDGs at global level, a Global  
Indicator Framework (GIF) presently consisting of 248 indicators (231 unique indicators) was adopted by the UN in 2017.
3.34
 Government of India is committed to ensuring ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, 
Sabka Prayas’ which is in the spirit of the SDG motto of ‘Leaving No One Behind’. In this endeavour, 
MoSPI has been entrusted with the responsibility of development of National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, in sync with GIF, which can be used to monitor the progress of SDGs in the country. 
3.35
 MoSPI has initially developed a NIF for SDGs, consisting of 306 indicators along with data 
sources and periodicity, keeping in view the national priorities and needs. The NIF was developed 
following national consultation process involving Ministries/Departments of the Government, State Governments, UN agencies and other stakeholders. In compliance to the Cabinet approval, a High Level Steering Committee (HLSC) on SDGs was constituted by MoSPI under the Chairmanship of 
26
Chief Statistician of India (CSI) and Secretary, MoSPI with members from NITI Aayog, Ministry of 
Home Affairs, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate 
Change, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation to periodically
 review and refine the NIF. Under the ambit of HLSC, a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on 
SDGs has 
been constituted by the MoSPI in March 2020 under the Chairpersonship of DG (Statistics), 
MoSPI to provide technical support to HLSC. Any amendment(s) proposed in the NIF or any new 
proposal relating to SDGs is examined in the TAC and the recommendations of TAC are placed before HLSC for consideration. HLSC has been periodically refining the NIF. Presently in SDG-NIF 2023, there are 284 national indicators with identified data sources and periodicity (as on 29th June 2023) to monitor the progress of SDGs.

Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)
4.22 The Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) is the principal source of industrial statistics in India.  
It provides statistical information to assess and evaluate, objectively and realistically, the changes in 
the growth, composition and structure of the organized manufacturing sector comprising activities related to manufacturing processes, repair services, generation, transmission, etc. of electricity, gas, water supply and cold storage. The survey is statutory in nature under the Collection of Statistics Act, 2008 and the rules framed there under.
4.23
 The ASI extends to the entire country. The survey covers all factories registered under  
sections 2m (i) and 2m (ii) of the Factories Act, 1948. The survey also covers bidi and cigar  
manufacturing establishments registered under the Bidi and Cigar Workers (Conditions  
of Employment) Act, 1966. All the electricity undertakings engaged in the generation,  
transmission and distribution of electricity registered with the Central Electricity Authority  
(CEA) were covered under ASI up to 1997-98 irrespective of their employment size. Certain  
services and activities like cold storage, water supply, repair of motor vehicles and other  
consumer durables like watches, etc. are also covered under the survey. Defense establishments,  
oil storage and distribution depots, restaurants, hotels, cafe, computer services and the technical  
training institutes are excluded from the purview of this survey. The electricity undertakings registered 
with the CEA are not being covered under ASI w.e.f. 1998-99. However, electricity undertakings  
not registered with the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) continue to be covered under ASI.
4.24 In addition to the above, the coverage of ASI has now been extended beyond the  
purview of the section 2m (i) and 2m (ii) of the Factories Act, 1948 and the Bidi & Cigar Workers  
(Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966 as recommended by the Sub-Group on Sampling Design of 
ASI. For this purpose, Business Register of Enterprises (BRE) prepared by the respective states and  
Directory of Establishments based on Sixth Economic Census would be used by Industrial  
Statistics Wing (IS Wing).
4.25 To start with the implementation of the augmented frame, units with 100 or more  
employees not registered under Sections 2m (i) and 2m (ii) of the Factories Act, 1948, but included 
in the BRE of the respective states would be included in ASI frame. For this, BRE of Andhra Pradesh (AP) was included in the frame of Andhra Pradesh for ASI 2014-15, BRE   of Manipur, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan were included in the frame of  
respective states for ASI 2015-16 and BRE of Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh were included in the frame of respective states for ASI 2017-18 after verification of such units by FOD. This is a significant departure from past practices and it is an improvement in  
coverage of registered manufacturing sector.
4.26
 The data collected through ASI relates to capital, employment and emoluments,  
consumption of fuel and lubricants, raw materials and other input/output, value added, labour  
turnover and other characteristics of factories/industrial establishments. Fieldwork for central sample 
is carried out by the FOD. The IS Wing processes the data and publishes the results. The field work of ASI 2022-23 has commenced from December 2023.
39
4.27 Final results of ASI 2020-21 and ASI 2021-22 (V olume I and Summary Results for Factory 
Sector) have been released on website of the Ministry in February 2024. ASI publications (V olume I 
and Summary Results for Factory Sector) & unit level data are available on the website of the Ministry viz. (www.mospi.gov.in). These publications are freely available to users in electronic media and can be downloaded from the Ministry’s website.
State Participation in ASI
4.28 The State Directorates of  
Economics and Statistics (DESs) have been given necessary technical assistance and training for the purposes of participation in ASI. The participating States along with other desiring States have been provided with State sample list to take part in ASI survey work. IS Wing of DPD has provided all the survey and data   processing instruments [sample list, schedule, instruction manual, data entry package (e-schedule), validation rules, validation software, pooling methodology, etc.] to the states. Central sample unit level data for respective states were also shared with the State DESs along with Tabulation Software so as to enable them to generate district/micro level estimates, if necessary, by augmenting samples.
4.29
 In the recent past many changes have been made for improvements in the collection,  
processing and dissemination of ASI data. Over the last few decades, there has been a spurt in the 
growth of the number of registered factories and consequently in the number of units from which data are to be collected and analyzed annually. Considering operational constraint of FOD, NSSO the  
sample sizes in ASI were kept 76,613, 77,919, 77,737, 79,589 and 80,764 units during ASI 2017-18, ASI 2018-19, ASI 2019-20, ASI 2020-21 and 2021-22 respectively. In ASI 2022-23, 82,702 units comprising 62,746 census units and 19,956 sample units have been selected for the survey. Starting from ASI 2012-13, the survey is being conducted through ASI web-portal.
Glimpses of ASI Results
4.30 The final results of ASI 2020-21 and ASI 2021-22 (V olume I, V olume II and Summary  
Results for Factory Sector) were released in February 2024. ASI 2020-21 and ASI 2021-22 covered the  
entire country. The field work for ASI 2021-22 was carried out during the period from March 2023 to

the area enumeration work done by state primary workers and sample supervision of crop cutting  
experiments conducted by primary workers for estimating yield rate is conducted with a view to 
identifying the deficiencies in the system. The status report on ICS Scheme is presented to the State Governments. 
4.34
 Under the scheme, sample check on the primary field work relating to area enumeration in 
13887 (6209 for Kharif Season & 7678 for Rabi Season) sample villages in an agriculture year and 
supervision of 31324 (15662 for Central and State sample each) crop cutting experiments in each  
agricultural year are undertaken. The State Agricultural Statistics Authority (SASAs) of state  
governments also carry out sample check on area aggregation of 5349 villages of state sample to  
bolster data on area statistics in Sch. AS 1.1. The data collected through the supervision of crop cutting experiments at harvest stage are also utilised to compute 223 estimates of yield rate of specified crops under the ICS scheme. The estimates are also tapped, among other sources, by DES, M/o Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare in preparation of the advance estimates. 
4.35
 At present, NSSO (FOD) has made 
transition from the system of paper-based  
schedule to e-schedule for data collection

authors from different disciplines viz. Academia / Researchers/Central & State Govt. officers and 
otherinstitutions/Universities are invited to present research papers. Seventeen (17) National  
Seminars have been organized in reputed Institutes/Universities across the country till 2022-23. The 17th National Seminar covering NSS Survey Results taken up during 76th round (July – December, 2018) and 77th round (January – December, 2019) of NSS was organized at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), Kochi on 1 and 2 September 2022.
Use of Modern Technology/New Initiatives
4.49 Digitalisation of Socio-Economic Survey has been taken up from the 77th Round NSS, which 
started from 1 January 2019. Data in the field are being captured on IT enabled platform using  
tablets. While improving the quality of field data through in-built checks, it reduces the time lag in  
transmission of data as well.
4.50 The field work of on-going UFS phase (2022-2027) is being undertaken in digital mode 
through mobile/web applications developed by National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC),  
Hyderabad. Boundaries of blocks/wards/Investigator units/ towns are being drawn on satellite

imagery obtained from ‘Bhuvan’ portal using Quantum Geographic Information System  
(QGIS) software. Various attributes of structures are captured through the mobile application and  
embedded on satellite imagery. The digital mode envisages saving of the UFS maps along 
with associatedattributes on Bhuvan portal for ultimate use as sampling frame for conduct of  
Socio- Economic Surveys. NSSO (FOD) has also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding  
(MoU) with the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) under the Indian Space Research  
Organization (ISRO) to facilitate UFS in a digital mode using the state-of-the-art Geo ICT  
tools and techniques using Bhuvan Platform.
4.51 FOD has made transition from the system of paper-based schedule to e-schedule for  
transmission of data on Sample Checks on Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) (Sch. AS 2.0). An  
in-house data entry software was developed for AS 2.0 with technical expertise available at NSSO  
and was made available to all Regional Offices/ State Governments concerned during 2018-19.
Digitization of survey instruments and reduction in time lag in National Sample 
Surveys
4.52 In respect of systemic improvement and timely publication of data, modern IT tools are being 
adopted for improved data capturing and processing. As a part of this, all the ongoing NSS surveys  
are now being conducted in CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview), loaded with in-built  
Computer Scrutiny Points (CSP), for data validation at different stages of data capturing which is  
a cloud based digital platform ensuring simultaneous data processing. It enables faster validation  
and improved data quality along with the time cycle involved in publishing the survey result. 
This technological improvement caused a drastic reduction in the time lag of release of Quarterly  
Bulletins (QB) of PLFS from nine months to 2 months from the completion of field work. The time  
lag in release of PLFS Annual Report 2022-23 has also been brought down to around 3 months  
from 8 months of release of PLFS Annual Report 2021-22 from end of survey period.

Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS)
5.1 The MPLAD Scheme is a Central Sector Scheme, fully funded by the Government of  
India. The Scheme was announced on 23 December 1993 by the then Prime Minister of India  
in the Parliament. The main objective of the Scheme is to enable each Member of Parliament to  
recommend works of developmental nature with emphasis on the creation of durable community  
assets based on the locally felt needs of the people. Initially the administration of MPLADS was  
with the Ministry of Rural Development. However, since October 1994, the administration of the 
Scheme has been vested with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The scheme is governed by a set of Guidelines, which have been comprehensively revised from time to time. The present Guidelines were released on 22 February 2023, which came into ef fect on 1 April 2023.
5.2
 Salient features of the MPLAD Scheme
a) MPLADS is a Central Sector Scheme fully funded by the Government of India under  
which Hon’ble Members of Parliament are allocated annual authorization limit at the beginning of each financial year subject to certain conditions.
b) The basic principle to be followed by the Member of Parliament, the Nodal District  
Authorities, the Implementing District Authorities and the Implementing Agencies, while  
recommending and sanctioning the works under the scheme is that it leads to creation of durable  
public assets for public good of the society at large and does not have any restriction in its access  
and its usage to any section of the society. 
(c) MPLADS funds can be used for creation of immovable public assets on Government owned 
land, and movable public assets for Government owned and Government controlled institutions  
only, i.e. the Central, State/UT and local Governments, including Government aided institutions.
(d)  MPLADS Guidelines, 2023 provides an indicative list of works thacan be taken up under 
the   scheme. However, this list is not exhaustive and new works can be added to the list on the  
recommen  dations of a Member of Parliament, if the same complies with overall principles  
and objectives of the scheme.
(e) Any unspent balance out of the annual allocation of a particular Member of Parliament 
shall be carried forward and added to the annual allocation for that Member of Parliament for the  
subsequent Financial Year and the drawing limits of his account with Nodal District Authority  
 shall be fixed accordingly.
(f) Under MPLADS, the role of the Members of Parliament is limited to recommending the 
works. Thereafter, it is the responsibility of the District Authority to sanction, execute and complete  
the works recommended by Members of Parliament within the stipulated time period.

The elected members of the Rajya Sabha can recommend works anywhere in the State from which 
they are elected. Nominated Members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha can recommend works, anywhere in the country.
(h)  A Member of Parliament can recommend funds only up to $50 lakhs per year to all  
Societies/Trusts put together, provided that such Member of Parliament cannot recommend work of 
more than $1 crore for any particular Society/Trust during his/her entire term. The limit of $1 crore 
will start again on start of a fresh term of the individual concerned as Member of Parliament after  
their re-election/ nomination.
(i) Any Member of Parliament from anywhere in the country can consent their MPLADS funds 
up to $1 Crore per annum for rehabilitation and reconstruction works in areas affected by natural  
“Calamity of Severe Nature” declared by the Government of India in any part of the country, subject 
to other provisions of MPLADS Guidelines.
(j) When a “Calamity  of Severe Nature” has been declared by a State Government through a  
notification in the official gazette and not by the Government of India, Lok Sabha Members of  
Parliament from any constituency in that State and any Rajya Sabha Members of Parliament of that 
State can consent up to a maximum of $25 lakh per annum in the affected area(s) of the State.
(k) In order to give due attention to the development of infrastructure in the areas inhabited  
by Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Members of Parliament are to recommend  
every year, works costing at least 15 percent of the total MPLADS entitlement for the year  
for areas inhabited by Scheduled Caste population and at least 7.5 percent of the total  
MPLADS entitlement for the year for areas inhabited by Scheduled Tribe population.
(l) An elected Member of Parliament can also recommend works anywhere in the country  
outside the usual region in which he/she can recommend work as mentioned in Para 3.1.1 of  
the MPLADS guidelines subject to the ceiling of $25 lakh in a financial year per Member  
of Parliament for all such recommendations, except in case of calamity .
(m) The guidelines have a provision to provide assistance to individual differently abled  
persons by providing them prosthetics, wheelchairs, tricycles (manual or motorized), electric  
scotties, hearing aids and other such devices.
(n) The MPLADS funds, including those for the works to be executed for Trust, Societies  
and Cooperative Societies, can be pooled with individual/stand-alone projects of other  
Central and State Government schemes, as well as with that of local bodies, provided  
such works are otherwise eligible under MPLADS Guidelines. 
(o) The Project Management Unit under MPLADS Division (PMU-MPLADS) of  
Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has been designated as Central Nodal  
49
Agency for implementation of the Scheme. The actual fund shall only be with Central Nodal

Physical Performance
5.3 Since inception, the Scheme has benefited the local community by meeting various  
developmental needs such as drinking water facility, education, electricity, health and family  
welfare, irrigation, non-conventional energy, community centers, public libraries, bus  
stands/stops, roads, pathways and bridges, sports, etc. These works are sanctioned, executed  
and monitored as per the provisions of the MPLADS Guidelines. 
Since the inception of the scheme and as on 31 March 2024,are raised electronically.(p) The roles of Central Government, State Government, District Authorities and  
Implementing Agencies have been clearly defined in the MPLADS Guidelines, 2023 for  
implementation of MPLAD Scheme. The MPLADS Guidelines are available at Ministry’s  
website: mplads.gov.in 
Scheme Performance
 • 25,97,604 works have been recommended by MPs
 • 22,93,251 works have been sanctioned out of these recommended and taken up for 
  implementation  
 • 20,81,325 works have be en completed and assets made available for utilization by the  
  local communities.
After the implementation of eSAKSHI Portal from 1 April 2023, during 2023-24,
 • 1,15,530 works have been recommended by MPs
 • 72,054 works have been sanctioned; and
 • 3,256 works have been completed.
Financial Performance 
50
5.4 Since the inception of the scheme, an amount of $59505.73 crore has been released to  
Members of Parliament (Refer Graph for year-wise release of funds).
5.5 Since the inception of the Scheme, funds amounting to $59,505.74 crore have been released 
by the Ministry till 31 March 2023 and an expenditure of $59,250.75 crore has been incurred. 99.57  
per cent of the amount released has since been spent under the scheme since inception.
Revised MPLADS Guidelines and New Fund Flow Procedure
5.6 With the objective of making the scheme 
more flexible, efficient and effective and to bring it 
in line with the changing development needs of the community, a revised set of Guidelines have been released on 22 February 2023, which came into  
effect from 1 April 2023. eSAKSHI portal has been developed by the Ministry in collaboration with State Bank of India to implement revised fund flow procedure under MPLADS with effect from  
1 April 2023 in line with the directions of the  
Ministry of Finance.  
5.7
 Under the Revised Fund Flow Procedure, Members of Parliament will not be required to wait 
for the actual fund to be released by the Ministry before recommending new projects as they will be  
allocated annual drawing limits at the beginning of each financial year subject to certain conditions. 
The entire process of fund flow would operate on an IT platform viz. eSAKSHI which allows all the stakeholders, including Members of Parliament, the Central and State Government agencies, the  
district authorities etc. to monitor the status of funds and works on real time basis, which would  
facilitate effective implementation of projects under MPLADS and also bring in greater transparency and accountability in the system.
5.8
 After the implementation of eSAKSHI Portal under the new fund flow system from  
 1 April 2023, during 2023-24,
  •     Authorization amounting to $6817.47 crore has been released.
  •     An expenditure of $1089.94 crore has been incurred.
  •    15.98 per cent of the amount authorized have been spent.
5.9 As per the information received from the Districts, an expenditure of $60610.69 crore has  
been incurred under the scheme up to 31 March 2024, of which $1089.94 crore have been spent 
through the eSAKSHI portal during 2023-24.
Launch of eSAKSHI Mobile App
5.10 The Ministry launched the e-SAKSHI mobile application on 16 January 2024, which  
offers accessibility and convenience to the Hon’ble MPs to propose, track and oversee the projects in  
real-time, enhances decision-making processes, enabling swift responses to emerging needs  
51
or issues. The mobile app would provide the Hon’ble MPs with instant updates on the status  
and progress of their proposed projects and will also streamline communication between  
MPs and relevant authorities, facilitating a more efficient exchange of information.
5.11 This transparency not only fosters accountability but also instills public trust in the  
allocation and utilization of MPLADS funds. The mobile application also has the features for budget  
management facilitating monitoring of expenditure by MPs. The overall improvement in the  
implementation of MPLAD Scheme is attributed to the synergy attained by the cooperation of  
different stakeholders and operational experience gained over years, active participation and  
monitoring. The entire process of recommendation under the revised guidelines will operate through 
the web portal as well as mobile application. This innovative technology solution aims to enhance  
transparency, accessibility, and efficiency in the execution of MPLAD scheme.
Monitoring and Training
5.12 During 2023-24, in order to disseminate the new system and the associated guidelines  
to the tvarious stakeholders viz. State and District Authorities and to make them understand  
the functionality provided in the eSAKSHI Portal, MPLADS Division organized a series of  
workshops and seminars throughout the year. Twelve webinars and 38 workshops were  
conducted during the year across all States/UTs to guide the officers from Sate and District  
Authorities and creating awareness about the e-SAKSHI Portal.
5.13 In addition, a dedicated 24 x 7 helpdesk, (1800113702) has been set up for addressing /  
resolving issues related to e-Sakshi Portal. Kiosks/booths were set up during all Parliament  
Sessions since Monsoon Session of 2023 and queries raised by Hon’ble MPs/their representatives  
were addressed relating to portal overview, funds release, login issues and IDA related issues etc.

Chapter 6
Infrastructure and Project Monitoring
6.1 The Infrastructure Projects Monitoring Division (IPMD) of MoSPI undertakes the monitoring 
of projects of  $150 crores and above.  As per Government of India Allocation of Business Rules, 1961 
this division of Programme Implementation (PI) wing of MoSPI is mandated to fulfill the following: 
 • Project Monitoring - Monitoring of projects of  $150 crores and above 
 • Performance Monitoring - Monitoring of the performance of Infrastructure Sectors
Project Monitoring  
6.2 IPMD performs the implementation status of Projects above $150 crore through the  
project related data of Ministries/Departments/PSUs captured through the Online Computerized  
Monitoring System (OCMS) of MoSPI. A range of parameters are captured through OCMS in respect 
of the progress of the projects, financial parameters (cost and expenditure related), reasons/ issues  
accounting for slippages in the projects with respect to the planned schedule and original cost. Based on the aforementioned project data, MoSPI analyses the time and cost overrun of the projects and releases a monthly Flash Report (FR) and a Quarterly Project Implementation Status Report (QPISR).
6.3
 Through constant persuasion with the line ministries on the matter of project reporting of 
projects by the implementing agencies on the OCMS portal, a significant increase in the reporting of 
Central Sector Projects on the portal has been achieved. Presently, the reporting percentage stands at over 90 per cent.
6.4
 One of the significant contributions of the IPMD has been implementing systemic  
improvements periodically to expedite the project implementation. The IPMD serves as a crucial  
facilitator in identifying projects falling behind schedule or experiencing cost overruns during  
the regular project review meetings with the respective Administrative Ministries. This process  
assists Administrative Ministries in pinpointing project constraints and implementing corrective  
measures to address bottlenecks effectively.6.5
 As of 1 April 2024, 1873 projects, costing approximately  $26.88 lakh crore are on the  
monitor of MoSPI. While 779 projects are experiencing delays, project implementing agencies have  
reported a total cost overrun of  $5.01 lakh crore in 449 projects. The cumulative expenditure for the 1873  
ongoing projects up to March 2024 was $17.12 lakh crore, of which $4.22 lakh crore was spent during 
the current year 2023-24. During the period December 2022-March 2024, a total of 439 projects have 
been reported completion at a cost of $3.74 lakh crore.
6.6 Additionally, the data collected through the OCMS portal is utilized to generate inputs for  
several high-level meetings, including the PRAGATI monthly review, the Prime Minister’s State  
visits, for addressing Parliamentary Questions and requests under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
53
Time Overrun in Projects
6.7 The graph illustrates the trend in the percentage of projects experiencing time overruns 
from 2014 to 2024. It demonstrates an increase from 29.44 per cent in March 2014 to 41.59 per 
cent in March 2024. Some of the reasons of time overrun as reported by implementing agencies in OCMS include delays in land acquisition, delays in obtaining forest/environment clearances, lack of  
infrastructure support and linkages, delays in tie-up of project financing, delays in finalization of detailed engineering, changes in scope, delays in tendering processes, contractual issues, inadequate resources including manpower, etc.
Cost Overruns in Projects
6.8 The graph below illustrates the trend in the percentage of cost overrun for all  
under-implementation projects from 2014 to 2024. It indicates a decline from 19.4 per cent in March 2014 to 18.65 per cent in March 2024. Some of the reason of cost overrun as reported by  
implementing agencies on OCMS include change in scope of projects, under-estimation of  
original cost, changes in rates of foreign exchange and statutory duties, high cost of environmental  
safeguards and rehabilitation measures, increased land acquisition costs, monopolistic pricing by vendors of equipment services, general price rise / inflation and time overrun.

6.9 The distribution of project count categorized as on schedule, delayed, without date of  
commissioning, and ahead of schedule  from March 2014 to March 2024 can be seen from graph  
below :
6.10 Monthly Flash reports and quarterly review reports are prepared which include detailed  
analysis of time and cost overrun in respect of monitored projects. These reports are published on the 
website of the MoSPI.
6.11  The OCMS portal of MoSPI is in the process of being revamped. A common upload form  
catering to the requirements of MoSPI is being integrated with the portal of IIG ad PMG, which would 
require various line Ministries/Departments to update data in respect of their projects on one single unified portal and would simplify the project monitoring exercise.
Performance Monitoring - Monitoring of the performance of Infrastructure Sectors 6.12
  The IPMD also reviews the performance of 11 key infrastructure sectors including Power, 
Cement, Coal, Steel, Railways, Shipping and Ports, Fertilizers, Petroleum and Natural Gas, Civil  
Aviation, Roads and Telecommunication with reference to their pre-set targets for the  
period and achievement there against. An analysis of the information received from these  
Ministries/ Departments is fedin an intranet-based application for generating monthly  
Infrastructure Performance Review Report. The reports prepared are published on MoSPI website.

6.13  During FY 2023-24, the percentage of achievement relative to target values across various 
sectors is illustrated below : 
Appraisal & Approval (A&A) of Projects 
6.14 IPMD also provides inputs for the appraisal of projects undertaken by the Public Investment 
Board (PIB), Delegated Investment Board (DIB), Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure for Appraisal 
& Approval (A&A), Expanded Board for Railways (EBR), and for EFC and SFC appraisals. 
Trainings in Project Monitoring
6.15 IPMD organizes training programmes on ‘Project Planning and Management’ for various 
stakeholders (Line Ministries/ Implementing agencies of projects) in collaboration with institutes of repute. A mid-level five days residential training programme was organized from 26 Feb 2024 to  
1 March 2024 in collaboration with Management Development Institute (MDI), Gurgaon. The  
training programme covered topics related to Project Management in practice, planning,  
scheduling, resource allocation & costing, monitoring & control, risk management, project  
management simulation, project auditing, project communication, reporting etc., and 30  
participants from different Ministries and Departments participated.

Chapter 7
Indian Statistical Institute
7.1 The Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) was formally established on 17 December, 1931 
in a meeting presided by Sir R.N.Mookerjee, the first President of the Institute, and Professor  
Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was appointed as the Honorary Secretary. On April 28, 1932  
the Indian Statistical Institute was registered as a non-government and non-profit distributing  
learned society under the Societies Registration Act No. XXI of 1860. The Institute is now registered 
under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act XXVI of 1961, as amended in 1964. The institute was accorded ‘National importance’ through Indian Statistical Institute Act, 1959.
7.2
 As the Institute expanded its research, teaching, training and project activities, it started  
earning national/international recognition. The outstanding contributions made by the Institute in  
theoretical and applied statistical work culminated in the recognition of the Institute as an  
‘Institution of National Importance’ by an Act of the Parliament3 . The Institute was empowered  
with the right to hold examinations and award degrees/diplomas in Statistics and degree courses of  
Bachelor of Statistics (B. Stat.), Master of Statistics (M. Stat.) and Post Graduate Diplomas in SQC &  
OR and Computer Science were started from June 1960. The Institute was also empowered to  
award the Ph.D./D.Sc. Degree from the same year. Subsequently, Master of Technology  
(M. Tech) courses in Computer Science (CS) and in Quality, Reliability & Operations Research 
(QROR) were also introduced.
7.3 In 1995, by an amendment to the ISI Act4 , the Institute was further empowered to award  
degrees/diplomas in Mathematics, Quantitative Economics, Computer Science and such other  
subjects related to Statistics. This provided great encouragement to research activities not only in  
Statistics/Mathematics, but also in various branches of Computer and Communication Sciences,  
Natural and Social Sciences, Physics and Earth Sciences, Biological Sciences, Statistical  
Quality Control & Operations Research, Library and Information Sciences in a broader way.  
Over the years, the Institute has been playing a key role in the development of statistical theory and 
methods by promoting research and practical applications in different areas of natural and social  
sciences.
Rich heritage of the Institute
7.4 The Indian Journal of Statistics ‘Sankhya’ is being published by the Institute since 1933. It is 
considered as one of the leading statistical journals of the world. Pioneering research activities were carried out in many areas of statistical theory, especially in the corner as of multivariate analysis, sample surveys and design of experiments. Such activities were strengthened and new directions were opened up by Professor C. R. Rao and many others who joined the Institute in 1940s and the tradition continues. Research in economics was greatly stimulated when the Prime Minister of India, entrusted the preparation of the draft Second Five-Year-Plan of the country to Professor Mahalanobis and the Institute in the year 1954. The “Draft” submitted by the Institute under the leadership of Professor Mahalanobis with the planning models have since been regarded as major contributions to economic 
planning in India.

4 Indian Statistical Institute (Amendment) Act, 1995, No.38 of 1995 
57
7.5 The ISI played a pioneering role in starting the Statistical Quality Control (SQC)movement 
in India by organizing a visit of Professor W.A. Shewhart, the father of SQC, to India in November 
1947 and later by inviting other experts like Dr. W. E. Deming, Dr. Ellis R. Ott, Dr. H. C.  Tippet and Genichi Taguchi for the same purpose. SQC promotional work of the Institute then gradually spread all over the industrial centres in India under a comprehensive programme covering education and training, applied research and consultancy services. The Institute also became a permanent member of “Quality Council” of India.
7.6
 From the early days, the Institute has been interacting with many internationally reputed  
scientists in different disciplines from the world over. Some of these scientists have worked in the  
Institute for several months or even longer. Sir Ronald A. Fisher, a pioneer of modern statistics, was 
a regular visitor and lent considerable support to the Institute. Professor J.B.S. Haldane, a geneticist of international repute, was a member of the faculty for several years beginning from 1957. The  
celebrated mathematician, Norbert  
Wiener visited the Institute twice in 1954 and again in 1955-56. The other academic personalities whose visits influenced the development of the Institute include the  
Statisticians like Harold Hotelling, Frank Yates, Herman Wold, Edwin  
Harper (Jr.), H. Cramer and Peter J.  
Bickel; the Mathematicians like A.N. Kolmogorov, Yu, V . Linnik, J.L. Doob and there after Vaughan F.R. Jones; Statistical Quality Control experts like Walter Shewhart and G. Taguchi;  
Economists like Simon Kuznets, Paul A. Baran, Joan Robinson, Jan Tinbergen, Nicholas Kaldor, R.M.Goodwin, David Cox, Ruth Glass  
and J.K. Galbraith and more recently Amartya K. Sen, Robert Aumann, Lotfi A. Zadeh, Joseph  
E. Stieglitz, James A. Mirrlees, Eric Stark Maskin, Ei-ichi Negishi, Ada Yonath, David Jonathan Gross, Joachim Frank; Geologist like Pamela Robinson; Biochemists like N.W. Pirie and Linguists like D. Kostic. All along the Institute has tried to live up to Ronald Fisher’s dictum that Statistics is a “Key Technology” in view of its intimate relevance to all scientific endeavours, which involve  
experimentation, measurement and inference from sample to aggregate.
7.7
 In the field of Computer Science, the Institute has a rich tradition. In 1953, small analog  
computer was designed and built in the Institute. In 1956, the Institute acquired a HEC-2M  
machine from the U.K., which was the first digital computer in India. In early sixties, the Institute, in  
collaboration with the Jadavpur University, undertook the design, development and fabrication of a  
fully transistorized digital computer, called ISIJU-1, which was commissioned in 1966 by Shri M.C.  
Chagla, the then Minister of Education, Government of India. High quality research,  
publication and development in the different branches of computer sciences had been carried out  
by the internationally acclaimed computer scientists of the Institute over the last decade and their  
58
cocerted efforts have placed the Institute in the forefront in national and international scenario.

df  NCO is a classification of occupations which 
describes and assigns codes to the various 
occupations in the country and aligns it with the 
International Standard Classification of 
Occupations ( ISCO ). These codes are reviewed 
and updated periodically to refl ect 
developments in the labour market, particularly 
with the emergence of new occupations, as well 
as to align with changes in the international 
standard s. These codes also help in promoting 
international comparability of statistical data 
relating to occup ations. These occupational 
standards follow a scientific and hierarchical 
approach having major, minor and unit groups 
of classification which has evolved over the 
years to capture the structural changes in the Occupation

5 1. Prelude  
  
Administrative data are becoming 
increasingly important in today‘s 
governance f ramework. They are 
typically the spinoff of some 
operational exercise and are often 
viewed as having significant 
advantages over alternative sources 
of data. Although there is no denial 
to the fact that such data have 
merits, users should approach the 
analysis and place reliance on such 
data with great vigilante . Besides, 
they should be handled with the 
same level of prudence and critic  as 
they approach the analysis of data 
based on the their collection from 
other sources. The paper identifies 
some statisti cal challenges  in 
administrative data , with an 
objective of invigorating public 
discourse about the scope of 
administrative data usages, 
expanding the sweep of their 
analysis, and vitalizing stakeholders 
including researchers to traverse 
through some of th e contemporary 
statistical problems which 
essentially comes to the fore with use 
of such data.  
 
2. Background  
 
In  the  production of  official  
statistics,  for  a  certain  occurrence ,  
the source of availab ility of data  
may be either through the statisti cal    
surveys    or through the    
administrative  processes. In the se 
day and age ,  the  amalgamation of  these  two  sources  is  a propitious 
and in genious blue print which 
affects the quality  and  quantity  of  
research  and  increases  the  
potential   of  data  (Künn,  2015).  
However,  this  usage  is  often  
accompanied  by  serious  challenges,  
given  the simple fact that the 
purpose of designing the two sources  
is  different.  Administrative  data  
are  defined  as  data  sets  collected  
by  go vernment  institutions  or  
agencies  for  tax,  benefit  or  public  
administration  purposes  (UNECE,  
2011). According   to   Penneck   
(2007)   surveys   differ   from   
administrative   data   in   the   sense   
that   they   are   specifically   
designed   for   analytical   purposes,   
so   coverage of population, 
definitions, methodology and time  
can  be  designed  to  meet  these  
analytic  needs.  However, the 
sample size might be a problem if it 
is small  since  large -scale  surveys  
are  expens ive  and  small -scale  
surveys  have  limited  use.  Samples 
are also subject to errors and non -
response bias.  In  addition, observes 
Penneck, we cannot be sure of the 
precision of  survey  responses,  
compared,  for  example,  with  the  
administrative  data  collected  for 
tax purposes. Administrative 
systems also require data from 
individuals, but the latter time and 
again is dovetailed as a vital 
component of  the  administrative  
6 process  rather  than  as  an  
additional  statistical  burden.   
 
As ha s been noted  above, 
Administrative data are data 
generated during the course of some 
operation, and then retained in a 
database. They are becoming 
increasingly important as the 
possible insights from such sources 
of data is being recognized and also 
since the alternative sources of data 
become more costly or difficult to use 
(e.g. because of declining response 
rates in surveys). Generally , this 
means that the analysis of 
administrative data is secondary —
the data are being remodeled —
although this is not alwa ys so. The 
existence  of large, often 
administrative  data sets, offering 
potential for secondary analysis, was 
one of the primary drivers behind 
the development of data mining 
technology (Handet al., 2000) as well 
as the modern rise of interest in ‗big 
data‘. But the analysis of 
administrative data p oses new 
statistical challenges. This can be 
appreciated by a casual scrutiny of 
the examples in most basic statistics 
texts, which will involve ‗random 
samples‘  in almost all  experiments : 
administrative data are , by 
definition, typically not random 
samples. The aim of this paper is to 
explore these statistical challenges 
and to stimulate discussion. The 
hope is that it will help to focus 
attention on what is needed for valid 
and accurate analysis of 
administrativ e data. The need is illustrated by the comment made by 
Wallgren and Wallgren (2014), on 
the closely related topic of analysing 
data from statistical registers:  
 
‘Although register -based statistics 
are a common form of statistics 
used for official statistic s and 
business reports, no well -
established theory in the field 
exists. There are no recognised 
terms or principles, which makes 
the development of register -based 
statistics and register -statistical 
methodology all the more difficult. 
As a consequence ad h oc methods 
are used instead of methods based 
on a generally accepted theory.’  
 
There are many definitions of 
statistics. This is because the 
discipline has various aspects, 
including the study of methods for 
collecting, presenting, interpreting 
and analysi ng data, but also because 
it involves expertise in coping with 
uncertainty and chance. The 
diversity in the words of Hand (2008)  
has been captured as ― Statistics is 
the technology of extracting meaning 
from data and of handling 
uncertainty ‖. There are fewe r 
definitions of administrative data.  
The Organisation for Economic Co -
operation and Development 
(Organisation for Economic Co -
operation and Development, 2016) 
defined administrative data as 
having the following features:  
 
(a)  The agent that supplies the  data 
to the statistical agency and the unit 
to which the data relate are usually 
7 different, in contrast with most 
statistical surveys;  
 
(b)  The data were originally 
collected for a definite non -statistical 
purpose that might affect the 
treatment of the s ource unit;  
 
(c)  Complete coverage of the target 
population is the aim;  
 
(d)  Control of the methods by which 
the administrative data are collected 
and processed rests with the 
administrative agency.  
 
The definition continues by saying 
that ‘In most cases  it is normal to 
accept (and expect) that the 
administrative agency will be a 
government unit that is responsible 
for implementing an administrative 
regulation’.  
 
Instead, although accepting that the 
features described above do 
characterize administrative  data, it 
is worthwhile considering 
Nordbotten (2010) who plain ly 
makes a straightforward  divergence 
between statistical data and 
administrative data. Statistical data 
are collected primarily for statistical 
purposes —e.g. to summarize in order 
to shed ligh t on the system 
generating the data, or to make 
predictions. In contrast, 
administrative data are initially 
collected for some administrative 
purpose —to run an organization, 
such as a company, government, 
charity, school, hospital, and so on. 
Running the o rganization might 
require on -going operational analysis of the data but, once collected and 
stored, the data can later be 
analysed to shed light on what has 
happened, to help to predict what 
might happen in the future, and to 
evaluate systems and their 
performance, i.e. the data can later 
be subjected to statistical analysis. 
Often statistical data consist of mere 
samples from the universe of 
possible values which could have 
been obtained, and these may have 
been collected by surveys or 
experiments for exam ple. In 
contrast, administrative data will 
ideally consist of data on all of the 
cases, records or transactions in 
some population. This leads to 
evolving of  a metaphysical  
distinction: sample data are used to 
obtain estimates of a population 
parameter. I n contrast, 
administrative data are summarized 
to obtain a descriptive feature of the 
population.  
 
Transaction data are an important 
kind of administrative data 
concerned with events, typically with 
sequences of events. Usually the 
prime operational purpo se of 
collecting the data is to inform the 
transaction (e.g. to decide how much 
to charge a customer or to decide 
how much tax someone should pay), 
but once collected the data can be 
retained in a database and analysed 
to improve understanding of the 
organ ization‘s operations.  
 
At first glance, though appearances 
can be deceptive, administrative 
8 data appear to have several 
advantages compared with statistical 
data.  
 
(a)  Since the data have already been 
collected, no additional cost appears 
to be incurred in collecting them.  
 
(b)  In a sense, we might reasonably 
expect that ‗all‘ the data are 
available. After all, the data 
generators will certainly process and 
can retain details of all its 
transactions.  
 
(c)  The data might be of high 
quality, since the eff ectiveness of the 
operation of the organization 
depends on this.  
 
(d)  The stored data will certainly be 
timely and might be regarded as up 
to date as it is possible to achieve, 
since they describe the organization 
as it is, or at least as it was when the  
last change was made. This 
advantage is strikingly illustrated in 
the use of administrative data to 
derive estimates of population 
attributes at times that are 
intermediate between decadal 
censuses, and in essentially real time 
estimates of price inflatio n. 
 
(e)  In a real sense administrative 
data often tell us what people are 
and what they do, not what they say 
they are and what they claim to do. 
We might thus argue that such data 
get us closer to social reality than do 
survey data.  
 
(f)   Administrative  data may provide 
tighter definitions than alternative 
sources of data. Wallgren and Wallgren (2014), gave examples of 
data about income and children in 
families. Where the time restrictions 
on eliciting responses to a survey 
might mean one must simply ask  
‗what is your yearly income before 
tax?‘, administrative data might, 
depending on the source of the data, 
specify whether this means 
‗disposable income, taxable income, 
earned income or income including 
unearned income.  
 
Unfortunately, although all of th ose 
advantages of administrative data 
might apply in an ideal world, in 
practice things are typically not so 
straightforward. Regarding (a), effort 
will normally be required to extract 
the data, to clean them and possibly 
to link them to other datasets. 
Moreover, although data may be free 
for the organization which collected 
them, other organizations which 
wish to use these data may have to 
pay—and the cost must be balanced 
against that of data from alternative 
sources, such as surveys or 
administrative dat a collected by 
other organizations. Regarding (b), 
data will usually enter a database 
via a complex social process —the 
sample of records in a database may 
not be representative of the 
population to which one wishes to 
make an inference. An operational 
database might not have a form 
which is convenient for statistical 
analysis exercises. In particular, 
different parts of an organization 
might use different database 
systems —indeed, there is a large 
9 amount of current activity as 
organizations seek to put all o f their 
data into a single data repository (a 
data warehouse, for example).  
 
It is worth noting that it is 
sometimes useful to distinguish 
between two kinds of administrative 
data. The first kind is that which is 
necessarily collected during the 
course of some operation. Credit card 
transaction data, for example, 
necessarily involve the recording of 
the amount spent, the currency and 
the business where the transaction 
occurs, since these items of 
information are needed to run the 
credit card operation. The second 
kind is additional information which 
is not needed for an operation, but 
which is helpful for other reasons, 
and which is collected during the 
administrative process. The age and 
gender of a customer might fall into 
this category: a product might be  
bought by anyone, but it could be 
useful to analyse the customer‘s 
details later to inform new 
marketing strategies. In some sense 
this second kind of data lies between 
administrative and statistical: they 
are collected for statistical rather 
than operati onal purposes, but they 
are collected during and as part of 
the administrative process. There is 
an important lesson to be taken from 
this: benefits can be gained from 
involving the statisticians and data 
analysts in the data collection stage. 
This is not a new lesson: we recall 
Ronald Fisher‘s comment that  
 ‗to call in the statistician after the 
experiment is done may be no 
more than asking him to perform 
apost -mortem examination: he 
may be able to say what the 
experiment died of  ‘ 
 
This  last  point  lea ds  into  the  
modern  world  of  so -called  ‗big  
data‘.  The term has no universally 
accepted definition, but for this 
paper this may be defined as the 
result of some automatic data 
collection system. Indeed, many 
including Hand (2008) have argued 
elsewh ere that the data revolution is 
not so much a consequence of the 
size of modern data sets and the 
ability to store them (big data) but 
rather of the fact that data are 
nowadays largely collected 
automatically without requiring 
explicit human effort. Exampl es of 
automatically collected data are 
everywhere and include personal 
health data collected by wrist 
monitors, automated monitoring of 
tickets as people travel through a 
rail network, telemetry of engine 
functioning and recording of 
metadata of phone call s. Data 
arising from the so -called ‗Internet of 
things‘ would clearly be of this type.  
 
Sen (2009) observed that there are 
three broad categories of purposes 
for which administrative data are 
collected.  These are: (a) monitoring 
of government programmes and 
other forms of government 
intervention; (b) enabling regulatory 
activities and audit actions; and (c) 
10  targeting outcomes of government 
interventions. He notes further that 
in  the  Indian  context,  a  very  
large  volume  of  data  is  generated  
by  administrative   ministries   and   
state   governments   for   each   of   
these   purposes.  
 
3. Administrative Statistical 
Systems in India  
 
Administrative Statistics is generally 
collected by State Governments; 
consisting of statutory 
administrative return s and data 
derived as a by -product of general 
administration. The Rangarajan 
Commission (2001), while dealing 
with the Administrative Statistical 
System observed as under:  
 
The system of administrative 
information system, whose 
essential purpose was to aid  the 
Government Departments in the 
execution of their functions of 
implementation of different Acts, 
Rules and Regulations of 
Governments. Even when such 
Acts were passed by the Central 
Government, their implementation 
was decentralised through the 
State G overnment Departments 
and their district or other sub -
offices. The statistics thus had a 
direct purpose of being not only of 
interest to but also necessary for 
the working of the departments. 
The regularity, quality, and 
completeness in the collection of 
these statistics, interwoven with 
the working of these departments, were thus indirectly ensured. The 
quality of this system is thus 
directly related to the interest the 
administrative departments take 
in it and the effective use they 
make of it. It is howe ver a fact that 
strictness in the administrative 
functions of several departments 
of most State Governments is 
waning, resulting in a virtual 
neglect of the information system.  
 
There are other advantages too in 
the system of collection of statistics 
throu gh the administrative set up. 
The collection of data by 
departmental agencies does not 
involve special costs. The collection is 
oriented to definite purposes and the 
record and verification of 
information is part of 
administration. Departmental 
agencies an d officials have not only 
good knowledge of the subject, but 
also of local language and local 
conditions, especially rural. 
Information collected is relevant and 
direct, and the respondents do not 
have to make calculations before 
answering a query. It is h andled by 
agencies that have special knowledge 
of the subject. Finally, there is an 
identifiable purpose in their data 
collection and they are in the best 
position to interpret the data. All 
this has lent a solid foundation to the 
decentralised administrat ive 
statistical system, and in turn, to the 
Indian Statistical System. An 
impression is carried by many that 
data collected by substantive 
Government departments are likely 
11  to suffer from bias. Therefore, they 
suggest that an independent agency 
should coll ect data to ensure 
objectivity. But, ignorance should not 
pass off as objectivity, making the 
solution worse than the problem. 
While the impression might be true 
for certain departments at certain 
times, it is easy to overstress the 
point as a justificatio n for the 
solution suggested.  
 
4. Statistical Usages of 
Administrative Data in 
India  
 
Sen (2009) has presented the 
detailed account of the usage of the 
administrative data for the 
statistical purposes in India. He has 
noted that the   earliest   and   
perhaps    the   most   important  
form  of  administrative  record  use  
in  Indian  statistics  is  the  land -use  
data  that  is  generated  on  a  
regular  basis  by  the  land  revenue  
administration  of  State  
Governments.    In  earlier  times,  
the  land   use  records  not  only  
captured  the  area  under  various  
crops,  but  also  the  output  of  each  
crop.    Over  time,  however,  there  
were  questions  raised  regarding  
the  accuracy  of  the  crop  estimates  
obtained  from  visual  inspection   
carried  out  by  land  revenue  
officials.    Consequently,  crop  
cutting  experiments  were  
introduced  to  measure  the  yield  of  
each  crop.    Nevertheless,  the  land  
use  records  continue  to  be  central  to  the  whole  process  of  
agricu ltural  production  estimates.    
In  the  first  instance,  they  are  
used  as  sample  frames  in  order  to  
determine  where  crop  cutting  
experiments  would  take  place. 
Given   the   centrality   of   
agriculture   in   the   Indian   
context,   administrative   record   
keeping   in   agriculture   goes   
beyond   merely   production 
estimates.    For  many  years  there  
has  been  a  regular  system  of  
recording  prices  of  agricultural  
commodity  at  the  market  yards  
and  also  the  qua ntum  of  market  
arrivals  of  agricultural  produce.    
These  are  central  to  the  existing  
system  of  recording  agriculture  
output  and  consumption in value 
terms for the country. In   the   case   
of   the   industrial   sector,   
registrations    under   the   Factories  
Act  provide  the  basic  frame  for  
all  industrial  estimation,  whether 
it is done through the Annual Survey 
of Industries or the Index of  
Industrial  Production.  Even the 
wholesale price index relies heavily 
upon this fra mework.    One of the 
residual legacies of the industrial 
licensing system in India is the 
existence of a number of industry 
specific associations which have for 
many years carried out the 
responsibility of collating production 
and price data for their par ticular 
industrial sector.  These should be 
treated as administrative data since 
they are mandated by   industry -
specific   legislation   and   they   
continue   to   be   important   
12  sources  of  data  for  production  
estimates,  although  their  price  
data  is  never used.  This is 
particularly important for the 
mining sector and for heavy and 
basic industries.  
 
In  recent  years,  the  emergence  of  
regulators  in  some  areas  of  
industry  has  led  to  a  new  source  
of  administrative  data  i.e .  
regulatory records.    These  have  
been  found  particularly  useful  in  
areas  such  as  pharmaceuticals  and  
power.    The  role  of  industry  
associations  and  regulatory  
authorities  has  been  especially  
important  in  a  number  of  
commerc ial  service  sectors.    
Indeed,  practically  all  the  data  for  
the banking  and  financial  sectors,  
including  insurance,  is  derived  
almost  exclusively from regulatory 
demands.  This is also true of 
practically the entire transport 
sector inclu ding road, air and marine 
transport.    Since  the  privatization  
of  the  telecom  sector  from  mid  
90s,  the  primary  data  source  has  
shifted  from  returns  from  the  
public  sector  companies  to  
regulatory data provided by the 
Telecom Regulat ory Authority of 
India.  It is  believed  that  as  the  
process  of  private  participation  in  
a  number  of  other  sectors  
accelerates,  new  regulatory  
authorities  will  have  to  be  created  
and  regulatory  records  will  become  
increasingly  important  as  source of 
statistical data.   Although India has 
a long history of labour regulation and regular reporting  of  data  from  
establishments  of  above  a  
particular  size,    and  it  also   has   
a   fairly   wide   network   of   
employmen t   exchanges   spread   
throughout  the  country,  neither  of  
these  two  sources  of  
administrative  data has been found 
to be particularly useful in 
monitoring employment trends in 
the country.  This is partly because 
of the fact that India has a ver y   
large   proportion   of   its   non -
agriculture   labour   force   in   the   
unorganized  sector,  especially  in  
own  account  enterprises,  which  do  
not  come under any labour 
regulation.  Nevertheless, even for 
the organized sectors  of  the  
economy,  these  data  sources  have  
not  been  found  to  be  particularly 
accurate. In  so  far  as  the  social  
sectors  are  concerned,  the  quality  
of  administrative  data  in  both  the  
health  and  education  sectors  have  
dropped alarmingly.  In the past, 
hospitals and public health care 
system records  and  their  
counterparts  in  the  public  
education  system  could  provide 
fairly comprehensive information on 
these two sectors.  However, with  
increasing  private  participation,  
especiall y  in  a  situation  of  under -
regulation  the  coverage  has  
dropped  to  such  an  extent  that  
such  data  cannot be relied upon 
except perhaps as sentinel 
indicators.  More recent public  
interventions,  such  as  the  Central  
Government‘s  operatio n  of  the  
Integrated  Child  Development  
13  Scheme  and  the  Government  
aided  local  schemes,  have  opened  
up  new  sources  of  administrative  
data,  but  their  reliability is yet to 
be established. The  situation  is  
considerably  better  in  ter ms  of  
environment  statistics, almost all of 
which are obtained from 
administrative data with a  
reasonably  high  degree  of  
confidence.    Nevertheless, there are 
clear weaknesses present in some 
key areas such as air and water 
quality.      
 
5. Types of  Administrative 
Sources  
 
The potential range of 
administrative sources that could be 
used for statistical purposes is large 
and growing. The following list is not 
meant to be exhaustive; instead it 
aims to show range and types of 
potential data sources, as  the final 
step towards arriving at an 
operational definition of 
administrative sources1.  
 
 Tax data  
Personal income tax  
Value Added Tax (VAT)  
Business / profits tax  
Property taxes  
Import / export duties  
 Social security data  
Contributions  
Benefits  
Pensions

6. Issues and Concerns in 
Administrative Data  
 
Sen (2009) opined that there are two 
main issues that create problems in 
more extensive use of administrative 
records in the Indian context.  The  
first  is  that  there  is  often  a  
divergence  between  the  nature  of  
data  required  for  administrative  
purposes,  especially  when  the  
objective  is  to  monitor  
programmes,  and  the  nature  of  
the  data  that  would  be  required  
for  statistical  purposes.    Since  the  
data  collection  machinery  is  
generally  under  administrative  
control  of  the  programme  
authorities  rather  than  the  
statistical  authority,  the  
14  introduction  of  appropriate  
questions  and  indicators  quite  
often  becomes  a  victim  of  the   
need  to  keep  the  keeping  process  
manageable.    In recognition of this 
issue, recently the Indian 
Government has raised the status of 
the statistical officers in the line 
Ministries significantly and, 
hopefully, over time their voice 
would be heard    more   prominently   
while   designing   the   
administrative   data   collection 
system.  A similar effort is also 
underway to persuade the State 
Governments   to   give   more   
emphasis   on   statistical   
components   of   administrative 
records. T he second problem relates 
to the accuracy of the data. Although 
the  completeness  of  coverage  is  
frequently  an  issue,  there  is  really  
no insurmountable   problem   in   
using   the   data   if   certain   
statistical   corrections  can  be  
made.     Inaccuracy,  however,  can  
render  the  data  completely  useless  
for  statistical  purposes. By  and  
large,  it  has  been  found  that  in  
situations  where  the  data  is  
collected  for  monitoring  
programmes,  the  quality  of  the  
data  bec omes  highly  questionable.  
This  is  a  particular  problem  in  
the  social  sectors  and  also  in  data  
that  is  collected  by  the  taxation  
authorities. On the other hand, when 
the purpose is mainly for regulatory 
oversight the quality of data te nds to 
be high.  
 The major issues, concerns and 
challenges of the administrative data 
may be listed as below:  
 
6.1. Population Coverage 
Issues  
 
A system of administrative records 
defines the population covered by 
legislation based on the scope of the 
program in tended for registration. 
This population is often limited by 
specific demographic or economic 
characteristics. According to Johnson 
and Moore (2008), in some cases 
individuals may need to undertake 
some actions to become part of the 
administrative system. It is therefore 
important, say the authors, to 
consider what encourages individual 
units to be part of schemes. There 
may be some favouring factors for 
some individuals to avoid 
registration, especially if their 
circumstances place them close to a 
threshol d that requires obligatory 
participation or gets associated with 
financial costs. Another factor is the 
change of policies that may fluctuate 
the population taken in study from 
year to year.  
 
The study unit needed for statistical 
purposes often focuses on  the 
characteristics of groups formed by 
units (e.g. enterprises operating in a 
particular activity or large 
enterprises), while the 
administrative data focus on 
identifying specific units so that 
based on their individual 
characteristics (e.g. full -time 
15  employees) certain actions can be 
undertaken. Thus, the differences in 
the entity reported in the tax 
statements limit the usefulness of 
the data for some types of research.  
 
6.2. Content Issues  
 
Johnson and Moore list several 
content issues that need to be 
considered while working with 
administrative data. One of them is 
the purpose for which administrative 
data are collected, which may have a 
significant impact on their 
usefulness for statistical purposes 
regarding the amount of available 
data, data definition s, consistency 
between different time periods and 
data quality. Many a times the 
usefulness of administrative registry 
systems is limited, because for 
example, only those variables needed 
to administer the tax and tax 
schemes are collected. These 
variables  can only be a small part of 
the data reported in an 
administrative form of 
compilation/reporting. In addition, 
because program requirements are 
defined by legislation, the concepts 
and definitions of variables used to 
meet program needs do not 
necessarily  match those required for 
social or economic analysis 
(Brackstone, 1987). An important 
aspect of the data content is 
continuity over time of the variables 
included and their definitions. 
Coverage and content in 
administrative data systems may be 
subject to  discontinuities resulting from changes in laws, regulations, 
administrative practices or the scope 
of the program (Brackstone, 1987). 
Administrative data systems also 
can not ensure perfect data quality. 
Information that might be important 
for statisticia ns, but less important 
for administrative purposes, is often 
reported and processed imperfectly, 
noticed Johnson and Moore (2008). 
Another issue pointed out by 
Johnson and Moore (2008) is data 
reliability which can be affected if 
the information provided t o the tax 
entity can cause profits or losses for 
the declaring subject. Moreover, 
given that the data collected and 
processed for administrative 
purposes are generally given priority 
over what is required for statistical 
purposes, the amount of processing 
required to provide administrative 
data suitable for statistical purposes 
may affect the time that these data 
are made available to statisticians.  
 
6.3. Privacy Issues  
 
In their work Johnson and Moore 
(2008) consider data privacy as a 
very important issue. The  authors 
explain that any use of 
administrative data for research 
purposes should take into account 
the laws that protect the privacy of 
the data. The research of 
administrative data is often limited 
to uses within the scope of an agency 
mission and should  be carried out 
only by persons working for the 
agency as employees, contractors or 
under Memorandum of 
16  Understanding that allow employees 
of various institutions to exchange 
the data. The way the public percept 
privacy protection of their data has a 
direc t impact on the continuity of the 
levels of declarations. Often, because 
of these factors, the available data 
does not contain identifying 
variables. For example, in the case of 
individual data from the 
administrative source, variables 
which directly ident ify the subject 
are missing. Of course in another 
scenario the availability of these 
variables could lead to wider 
statistical use and a combination of 
data from different sources.  
 
However, data confidentiality is of 
great importance to the current and 
future success of any administrative 
observation and registration. If the 
subjects do not believe that their 
data is sufficiently protected, 
response rates and overall data 
quality will be subject to 
deformation.  
 
6.4. Classification Issues  
 
The  classification   systems  used  
within  administrative  sources  may  
be  different  to  those  used  in  the  
statistical  world.  Even  if  they  are  
the  same,  they  may  be  applied  
differently  depending  on  the  
primary  purpose  of  the  
administrative  source ,  perhaps  
focusing  on  specific  attributes  of  
the  unit.  For  example,  an  
administrative  source  concerned  
with  licensing,  health  and  safety  or  environmental  protection  may  
be  more  interested  in  the  
economic  activities  of  a  bus iness  
that  are  of  most  concern  to  that  
source,  rather  than  the  main  
economic  activity of a business, 
which is required for statistical 
purposes. In  other  cases,  
classifications  in  administrative  
sources  may  not  be  applied  at  the  
level of detail required for statistical 
purposes, or the classification may 
simply not be a priority variable for 
the administrative source, resulting 
in quality deficiencies. Where  
classification  systems  or  versions  
are  different,  the  usual  solu tion  is  
to  construct conversion matrices to 
map the codes in the administrative 
classification to those  in  the  
statistical  classification.  Such 
mappings may be one to one, many 
to one, one to many or many to 
many. In the latter two cases, some 
sort of probabilistic allocation may be 
required. In addition to the use of 
common coding tools, the provision of 
coding expertise and training to 
administrative data suppliers can 
help to improve coding consistency. 
At the same time, it is always helpful 
for the statistician to stress the 
advantages of using a common 
classification system. It also helps to 
give early notice of any revisions to 
the classification system, and to 
provide as much help as possible to 
administrative data suppliers during 
the impleme ntation of the resulting 
changes.  
 
 
17  6.5. Timeliness Issues  
 
There  are  three  separate  issues  
relating  to  timeliness  that  affect  
the  usefulness  of  administrative 
data for statistical purposes:  
 Administrative data may not 
be available in  time to meet  
statistical needs  
 Administrative  data  may  
relate  to  a  period  that  does  not  
coincide  with  the  statistical 
reference period  
 Administrative  data  may  be  
measured  over  a  period,  whilst  
the  statistical  requirement is for a 
specific poin t in time (or vice -versa).  
Considering the first issue, there will 
generally be some sort of lag between 
an event happening in the real 
world, and it being recorded by an 
administrative source, this is then  
followed  by  a  further  lag  before  
the  data   are  made  available  to  
the  national  statistical  
organisation.  
 
The  second  issue  related  to  
timeliness  is  that  of  differing  
periods,  for  example  data  from 
annual tax returns are often only 
available several months after the 
end of the  tax  year,  so  are  
probably  not  suitable  for  monthly  
or  quarterly  statistics.  In some 
cases, however, annual 
administrative data can be used for 
shorter -period statistics, particularly 
if they are collected on a rolling annual basis. This can ha ppen if 
there is a requirement to spread the 
workload of collecting and processing 
these data by the administrative 
source throughout the year. As long 
as the distribution of the units for 
which data are collected during the 
year is sufficiently random, it  may be 
possible to derive meaningful 
monthly or quarterly statistical 
trend data from such sources.  
 
The third issue concerns the 
difference between data referring to 
a specific point of time and data 
relating to a period (e.g. an annual or 
monthly avera ge). For example, 
there  may  be  a  statistical  
requirement  for  employment  data  
on  a  specific  reference  date, 
whereas administrative data may 
only give periodical averages.  
 
6.6. Issues Relating to 
Inconsistency between 
Sources  
 
A  specific  problem  where  multiple  
sources  are  used  concerns  
inconsistencies  between those 
sources. Data from one source may 
appear to contradict those from 
another.  This  may  be  due  to  
different  definitions  or  
classifications,  differences  in  
timing,  or  si mply  to  an  error  in  
one  source.  This  can  happen  when  
comparing  administrative  data  
with  statistical  data,  or  when  
comparing  two  administrative  (or  
two statistical) sources.  
 
18  To resolve such conflicts it is 
necessary to establish pri ority rules, 
by deciding which source is most 
reliable for a particular variable. 
Once a priority order of sources has 
been determined for a variable, it 
should then be possible to ensure 
that data from a high  priority  
source  are  not  overwritten  by  a  
lower  priority  source.  This process 
is made much easier if source codes 
are stored alongside variables for 
which several sources are available.  
The  use  and  storage  of  dates  can  
also  be  helpful,  as  even  when one 
source is thought to be mo re reliable 
than another, data from that source 
that  are  ten  years  old  may  not  be  
of  higher  quality  than  data  for  
the  most  recent  period  from  the  
less  reliable  source.  A simpler 
method that may be appropriate in 
some cases is to load  data in reverse 
priority order, allowing data of 
higher quality to overwrite those of 
lower quality.  
 
The  more  data  sources  that  are  
used,  the  more  complex  this  
comparison  process  becomes,  but  
having  multiple  sources  often  
helps  to  v alidate  data  quality.  In  
some  cases, certain sources may not 
be used directly for statistical 
production, but purely for  
benchmarking  purposes  as  part  of  
a  quality  assurance  process.2 
                                                      
2An example of benchmarking, using maps to compare the 
coverage of a statistical business register with that of a 
commercial telephone directory can be found in the paper 
―The Development of Small -area Business Statistics in the 
United Kingdom‖   6.7. Issues relating to Missing 
Data  
 
The  problem  of  missing   data  is  
not  unique  to  administrative  
sources.  It  can  also  be  due  to  full  
or  partial  non -response  to  
statistical  surveys,  or  even  to  the  
removal  of  data  values  during  the  
editing  process.  However,  with  
administrative  sou rces,  the  issues  
can  sometimes  be  different,  
particularly  as  the  problem  of  
missing  data  can  often be more 
systematic. The main reasons for 
this are that a particular variable 
may not be collected at all by the  
administrative  source,  or  it  may  
only  be  collected  for  certain  
categories  of  units  where  there  is  
a  specific  administrative  
requirement.  
 
The variable may also simply be a 
low priority for administrative 
purposes, so the owners of that 
source do not see missing dat a as a 
problem. Some  of  the  standard  
solutions  for  dealing  with  non -
response  in  statistical  surveys  can  
also  be  used  to  solve  the  problem  
of  missing  data  in  administrative  
sources.  Various imputation 
methods, such as deductive, ‗h ot-
deck‘ or ‗cold -deck‘ imputation are 
often suitable where the problem 
only affects some of the units. In 
cases where most or all of the units 
are affected, a modelling approach 
may be more appropriate.  
 
19  6.8. Issues relating to 
Resistance to Change  
 
One of the  main barriers to the more 
effective use of administrative 
sources in official statistics, and one 
of the least recognised, can come 
from within the organisation. 
Statisticians may resist the use of 
administrative data because they do 
not trust data that t hey have not 
collected themselves. They often 
focus on the negative quality aspects 
of administrative data, and they 
have an over -optimistic view of the 
quality of survey data, often based 
on the largely untested assumption 
that survey responses actually 
comply with statistical norms.  
 
The solution is clearly through better 
education of statisticians regarding 
the possibilities offered by 
administrative sources, encouraging 
them to take a wider view of all the 
dimensions of quality, and focus on 
the impact  on data suppliers and 
users. In this context it is important 
to determine the real relative quality 
of survey and administrative data. 
For example, it is often assumed that 
data from administrative sources do 
not meet the requirements of 
statistical defin itions, whereas those 
from official surveys do. However, 
there may not be any real difference 
in practice, particularly if 
respondents to statistical surveys 
simply inform the same values from 
recent administrative returns, 
without paying attention to the 
investigators explications at the time of canvassing the Questionnaire or 
Schedule of enquiry.  
 
6.9. Issues relating to the 
Adequacy in Decision 
Support  
 
There can be difficulties in using 
administrative data to answer 
specific research questions. This 
might b e because the data were not 
collected with those questions in 
mind, because of quality issues that 
are irrelevant to operations but 
highly relevant to subsequent 
statistical analysis, because of 
changes in definitions of the recorded 
data items or for othe r reasons. This 
brings to the fore the issue of 
adequacy of administrative data in 
evolving a decision support system: it 
can be useful, if it is possible, to have 
statistical advisors in the Central 
Ministry/Departments as also in the 
States involved in t he data collection 
process. They might be able to think 
ahead and to expand the range of 
data collected so that they will be 
more able to anticipate a robust 
framework for generating the 
administrative data with a view to 
buttress a sound and robust decisi on 
support system.  
 
Statistical analysis methods are 
often divided into descriptive  and 
inferential .  Descriptive  methods are 
used to summarize a body of data so 
that the important messages within 
it can be readily grasped. We might 
summarize a distributi on of values 
by their mean and standard 
20  deviation, or the results of a census 
by using a series of counts organized 
as cross -tabulations. It goes without 
saying that the summary statistics 
that are appropriate will depend on 
the subject matter and on the 
questions to which answers are 
sought. Administrative data are 
often used for purely descriptive 
purposes —perhaps especially so in 
official statistics contexts, where we 
might want to establish the 
characteristics of some population.  
 
In contrast, inferent ial methods are 
used to make a statement about 
unobserved values or underlying 
mechanisms. We might be trying to 
infer the disease of a new patient, on 
the basis of analysis of patients with 
similar symptoms diagnosed in the 
past. We might be trying to for ecast 
whether inflation will go up or down 
next month. We might be trying to 
elucidate an underlying mechanism, 
so that we can understand how the 
data were generated, and perhaps 
influence things in the future. Much 
of the statistical theory of inference 
is based on the notion of random 
sampling from a (possibly infinite) 
population of values. Because the 
sampling is random, solid 
mathematics (such as the law of 
large numbers and the central limit 
theorem) means that sound 
statements can be made about the 
characteristics of the population 
from summary statistics obtained 
from the sample. Moreover, error 
bounds can be put on the 
conclusions. We can say things such as ‗on average, 99 out of 100 of our 
intervals will cover the true 
population mean‘, so we can b e 
confident of our results (always 
subject to data quality issues, of 
course).  
 
But administrative data are not 
collected by such a random sampling 
process. We can certainly calculate 
descriptive statistics, summarizing 
the data before us and, if we are 
willing to assume that the data are 
perfect, with no missing or distorted 
values, then this will accurately 
summarize the population which led 
to our data. We can make a 
statement such as ‗this is the true 
population mean‘.  
 
Economic and social measures su ch 
as gross domestic product, the 
consumer price index and national 
wellbeing are what are called 
pragmatic measures (see, for 
example, Hand (2004)): the definition 
of the concept and the way that it is 
measured are two sides of the same 
coin. Change the m easurement 
procedure and you change the thing 
being measured, with different 
measures being suitable for different 
purposes. It is not a question of any 
of these being more ‗right‘ than the 
others, but simply that they measure 
slightly different things. Th is means 
that they have different properties 
and are suited to answering different 
questions. Increasingly, interest is 
turning to the possibility of using 
administrative data for measuring 
productivity and price inflation. 
21  Instead of conducting surveys of  
businesses to obtain data, the data 
can be automatically transmitted 
from the transaction to the database.  
 
Scanner data, such as retail 
purchase data obtained directly from 
the point -of-sale machine, provide an 
example, yielding data that are ideal 
for use in price index calculation. 
Moreover, such data also give 
information on the volume of 
different goods purchased, so that 
weights can be chosen. But issues of 
selection bias still apply: not all 
purchases are made through such 
routes, and we cannot ass ume that 
those purchases which are made in 
this way represent a random or 
representative sample of all 
purchases. A variant of this uses 
Web-scraped price collection, being 
explored by various national 
statistical offices.  
 
One of the problems with Web -based 
tools is the rate of change of that 
technology. Companies appear, grow 
to a massive size and vanish at a 
dramatic pace.  
 
7. Sectoral Position in India: 
Observations of 
Rangarajan Commission  
 
7.1. Agricultural Statistics  
 
• Statistics of crop production – 
both area and yield – are based on 
scientifically designed 
methodologies.   
• Timely Reporting Scheme 
(TRS) and the Improvement of Crop 
Statistics (ICS) Scheme.  
 
• At present, the area statistics 
are generated through complete 
enumeration in the temporarily 
settled States while in the 
permanently settled States these are 
arrived at through a sample of 20 per 
cent villages covered by the 
Establishment of an Agency for 
Reporting Agricultural Statistics 
(EARAS) scheme  
 
• The Commission has, 
therefore, recommended t hat crop 
area forecasts and final area 
estimates issued by the Ministry of 
Agriculture should be based on the 
results of the TRS in the temporarily 
settled States and on those of 
EARAS in the permanently settled 
States.  
 
• The Commission is of the view 
that it is necessary to make an 
objective forecasting based on timely 
and detailed information on crop 
condition, meteorological 
parameters, water availability, crop 
damage, etc.  
 
• While the use of Remote 
Sensing Technology does offer an 
alternative route f or the regular flow 
of crop statistics, there are a number 
of issues that require to be sorted out 
before this can become extensively 
operational. Meanwhile, the existing 
programmes of Remote Sensing 
22  Technology must be pursued with 
active cooperation from the 
concerned agencies.  
 
• The data collected through 
Agricultural and Livestock Censuses 
are required for identifying and 
formulating policies and programmes 
for the rural population. However, as 
the results of these censuses are not 
available in time, th is defeats the 
very purpose for which these 
censuses are conducted. To 
circumvent these problems, there is 
a need for conducting the censuses 
not as complete enumeration but as 
sample censuses.  
 
• Further, no relationship has 
been worked out based on the d ata 
collected through these two censuses 
because they are conducted 
independently with different field 
agencies, reference periods and basic 
units of enumeration. In view of 
several operational and substantive 
gains, the Commission has 
recommended the inte gration of the 
Livestock and Agricultural Censuses.  
 
7.2. Industrial Statistics  
 
• The Annual Survey of 
Industries (ASI) has been the 
principal source for most of the basic 
statistics of the Industrial Sector.  
 
• Estimates of the growth rates 
of industrial pro duction based upon 
the Index of Industrial Production 
(IIP) are extensively used for policy -
making at various levels in the Government and also for decision -
making in the banking and 
Corporate Sectors.  
 
• The IIP is compiled and 
released by the Central St atistical 
Organisation (CSO) within six weeks 
as per Special Data Dissemination 
Standards (SDDS) norms of 
International Monetary Fund, based 
on the data received from different 
agencies.  
 
7.3. Services Sector Statistics  
 
• The Follow -up Enterprise 
Surveys on th e Services and other 
sub-sectors (excluding 
manufacturing and repairing sub -
sectors), carried out by the Ministry 
of Statistics and Programme 
Implementation, take into account 
all types of enterprises (other than 
those in the public sector), 
irrespective o f their size, under the 
same survey year.  
 
7.4. Infrastructure Statistics  
 
• In developing a proper 
statistical database for the 
Infrastructure Sector, a major hurdle 
is the absence of a clear definition of 
―infrastructure‖.  
 
• Quantification of the 
infrastruc tural activities in the form 
of an index would help policy makers 
and researchers. The Commission 
has therefore recommended the 
construction of two types of indices 
in this regard. While the first one, 
23  called ―Infrastructure Index‖, will 
provide a summary measure of the 
growth of infrastructure, the second 
one, namely, ―Infrastructure 
Utilisation Index‖, will indicate the 
extent of utilisation of identified 
infrastructure facilities.  
 
7.5. Socio -economic Statistics  
 
• In the area of Population 
Statistics, the Po pulation Census is 
one of the most comprehensive 
sources of information on the size, 
distribution, living conditions and 
demographic characteristics of the 
population  
 
•  In the area of Health and 
Family Welfare Statistics, the three 
Departments of Health,  Family 
Welfare and Indian System of 
Medicines and Homeopathy of the 
Ministry of Health and Family 
Welfare have a separate system of 
data collection in their respective 
areas, while the Registrar General of 
India is responsible for collection and 
dissemina tion of vital statistics 
through its system of registration of 
vital events.  
 
• The country has a well -
established system of civil 
registration through an elaborate 
machinery right up to the district 
level and below for registration of 
vital events under t he Registration 
of Births and Deaths Act. The Civil 
Registration System, has the 
potential to generate vital rates for 
district level and below and form the basis for planning health and family 
welfare programmes at the local 
level as required in the 73rd and 
74thAmendments.  
 
• Labour and Employment 
Statistics are generated largely 
through the implementation of 
various labour laws and Regulations 
by the States and Centre. For the 
unorganised sector, the National 
Sample Survey Organisation and 
Central Statis tical Organisation are 
collecting and disseminating labour 
and employment -related data by 
conducting periodic sample surveys.  
 
•  The Registrar General and 
Census Commissioner of India is also 
publishing data decennially on 
workers and those seeking work 
through its census operations.  
 
• The data collected by Ministry 
of Labour through States suffer from 
very poor response in submission of 
returns, delays in filing the returns, 
poor quality, under coverage and 
time lag in publication of results.  
 
• Ministr y of Human Resource 
Development is the main agency for 
producing statistics on school 
education, which are collected 
through the States.  
 
• The All India Educational 
Survey conducted by the NCERT is 
another important source of 
statistics on school educati on in the 
country. In its review of the 
educational statistics system, the 
Commission took note of the 
24  deficiencies of quality, reliability, 
time lag and weak infrastructure in 
the collection and dissemination of 
education data  
 
• The Department of Women 
and Child Development should play 
a proactive role and strengthen its 
statistical set up. Indicators of 
gender disparity in various aspects of 
education, health and employment 
are required to be brought out. The 
CSO should develop a standard 
methodology for  the purpose of 
generating these indices to reflect 
the status of women in the country.  
 
• Environment Statistics is in 
its nascent stage in the country and 
as such there is a need to build up an 
efficient system for the collection of 
Environment Statistic s and 
developing environmental indicators 
based on the international 
framework provided by the United 
Nations Statistics Division.  
 
7.6. Financial and External 
Sector Statistics  
 
• The Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) is the principal though not the 
sole agency for collection and 
dissemination of statistics in respect 
of Financial and External Sector 
Statistics.  
 
• The other major public sector 
agencies and institutions that collect, 
compile and disseminate Financial 
Statistics are the Ministry of 
Finance, Securitie s and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), National 
Bank for Agriculture and Rural 
Development (NABARD) and 
Industrial Development Bank of 
India (IDBI).  
 
• There are continuing 
discrepancies in merchandise trade 
data, both exports and imports, 
between the Direc torate General of 
Commercial Intelligence and 
Statistics (DGCI&S) and RBI.  
 
7.7. Price Statistics  
 
• Central and State 
Government agencies collect the 
primary data on prices for varied 
purposes. The data on prices, both 
for the wholesale price index and 
consume r price indices, are not 
satisfactory.  
 
7.8. Corporate Sector Statistics  
 
• The Corporate Sector includes 
not only the domestic corporates but 
multinational companies of various 
types as well. In the Department of 
Company Affairs (DCA), the 
Registrars of Compan ies (ROCs) are 
primarily responsible for provision of 
the basic information on the 
Corporate Sector and the statistical 
machinery in the ROCs is 
inadequate to deal with this task.  
 
 
 
 
25  8. Quality &  Administrative 
Data  
 
Concerns  about  the  quality  of  
admin istrative  data  are  often  one  
of  the  main  barriers  to  their  
increased  use  for  statistical  
purposes.  These concerns may or 
may not be justified, and are often 
based only on specific aspects of 
quality, such as timeliness.  To 
properly address  these concerns an 
objective quality management 
framework is needed; one that 
considers all relevant aspects of 
quality, and allows an informed 
decision to be made.  
 
Many  statistical  organisations  
have  already  put  in  place  some  
sort  of  quality  framework  for  data  
collected  via  traditional  survey  
methods,  but  relatively  few  have  
extended this approach to cover data 
from administrative sources.3 
 
To  fully  understand  the  quality  of  
administrative  sources,  and  their  
impact  on  the  quality of statistics, 
the following elements may be 
considered:  
 
8.1. The quality of incoming 
data  
 
The incoming data, whether they are 
from administrative or survey 
sources, can be judged against set of 
criteria such as those listed above. 
                                                      
3Examples include approaches developed by Statistics 
Netherlands and Statistics Sweden   The most imp ortant criteria are  
likely  to  be  timeliness,  and  
relevance  in  terms  of  the  extent  
to  which  the  coverage  and  
concepts  of  the  source  meet  
requirements.  Comparability  with  
other  sources  can  also  be  
important,  and  some  sort  of   
exercise  to  reconcile  data  from  
different sources may be necessary 
from time to time to get a clear 
picture of quality. Quality check 
surveys are sometimes used for this 
purpose. One  point  worth  bearing  
in  mind  is  the  extent  to  which  
the  data  subject  has  an  interest in 
the quality of the data. The amount 
of effort and care put into providing 
the data will vary according to the 
perceived value or importance of the 
data collection, thus data subjects 
may, in some cases, provide better 
quality data for administrative 
purposes than they do for statistical 
purposes.  
 
8.2. The quality of data 
processing  
 
Even  if  the  incoming  data  are  
perfect,  their  quality  can  still  be  
affected  by  the  different  processes  
they  go  through  before   they  are  
used  for  statistical  outputs.  Ideally  
processing  should  improve  quality,  
but  unfortunately  this  is  not  
always  the  case. Examples of how 
data processing can affect quality 
include:  
 
 Data matching and linking – 
too many false ma tches will lead to 
26  errors in the data; too many false 
non-matches will lead to duplication, 
which will overstate the size of the 
population of interest, and possibly 
introduce bias.  
 Outlier  detection  and  
treatment  –  using  outlier  detection  
methods   to  detect  errors  can  help  
to  improve  the  quality  of  the  
data,  and  generally  the  more  
extreme the outlier, the more likely 
it is to be an error. However over -
zealous treatment  of  outliers  will  
result  in  genuine  data  values  
being  altered  and  can  lead to 
important trends in the data being 
missed.  
 Quality  of  data  editing  –  as  
for  outlier  detection  and  
treatment,  data  editing  should  
improve  quality,  but  if  not  done  
carefully  it  ca n  introduce  error  
and  bias . 
 Quality of imputation – if 
imputation is used to fill missing 
values or records it can  help  to  
improve  coverage,  but  again  the  
methods  used  need  careful  
scrutiny to avoid the introduction of 
bias.  
8.3. The quality of statistical 
outputs  
 
The usual  interpretation of the 
quality definition by statistical 
agencies is that quality is all about 
meeting user requirements. The 
quality of statistical outputs is 
therefore determined in this context. This means that it is necessary to 
determine these require ments, to 
discuss them with users, and to get 
regular feedback, for example via 
user satisfaction surveys.  
 
Moving from survey to 
administrative sources will clearly 
have an impact on output quality. 
Typically this impact may be positive 
for some quality criteria, and 
negative for others. In all cases, it is 
necessary to get an overall view of 
the impact, giving greater weight to 
those criteria the users consider to 
be the most important. For example, 
users may feel that an improvement 
in timeliness more t han compensates 
for a reduction in accuracy, 
particularly for short -period 
economic data. Another 
consideration should be the impact 
on time -series data, and whether it is 
possible to construct a consistent 
series of sufficient length following 
the change.  It can be particularly 
important to give at least as much 
weight to the views of users as to the 
perceptions of statisticians, which 
may, in some cases be too heavily 
focussed on traditional notions of 
accuracy. Overall, it is vital that any 
judgment of t he impact on statistical 
outputs is based on objective 
evidence rather than on supposition, 
as this is the only way to counter the 
potential for resistance to change.   
 
 
 
27  9. National Data Quality 
Assurance Framework 
(NQAF) in India  
 
A National Quality Assuranc e 
Framework contributes to the 
improvement in the National 
Statistical    System by laying    
down    quality    parameters    and 
corresponding good practices and 
elements that need to be in place to 
facilitate and ensure effective 
management of quality i n the 
statistical system, processes and 
products. The NQAF follows and 
aligns with the UN National Quality 
Assurance Framework 2019. The 
NQAF constitute the common 
quality framework in terms of 
quality management principles and 
their corresponding requirem ents 
and elements for assessing the 
Statistics which are produced and 
disseminated. These principles, 
requirements   and   elements   have   
been   constructed by   carrying   out   
certain customization/modifications    
on    the    UN    NQAF    2019    
based    on rounds   of consultations 
and review processes held with 
relevant stakeholders, viz.  Various 
Divisions of Ministry of Statistics 
&Programme Implementation 
(MoSPI) and key Central 
Ministries/Departments and 
States/UTs, to ultimately build a 
National Quality Assurance 
Framework (NQAF) appropriate to 
the Indian context.  Subsequently, 
the  QAF -ISS  was duly  approved 
and  recommended  for adoption by  
the  Task  Force  headed  by  Director  General  (Statistics),  
National Statistical Office (NSO) , 
MoSPI.4 
 
The  UN  NQAF  2019  Manual calls  
for  the  establishment  of  the  
necessary institutional   
arrangements   for   the   
development   of   an   NQAF.   This   
includes establishment  establishing 
a  quality  unit  at  the  NSO and a  
quality  task  force  (or working 
group) MoSPI, vide its Officer Order 
dated 18.03.2020, has designated the 
SSP Unit as the Standardization 
Cell akin to quality unit at NSO.  
 
10. Improving Usability  
 
Sen (2009) while noting in Indian 
context is of the opinion given th e 
size and diversity of the country and 
the limitations the reach of the 
Government, administrative records 
will always tend to be incomplete.  
The classic case of this is the 
coverage of the civil registration 
system, which is so low that it 
cannot be use d for measuring 
demographic parameters between 
the census years.  Many of these  
problems  can  be  tackled  through  
cross  checks  and  corrections  made 
through survey data.  For instance, 
in the case of civil registration, India  
operates  a  sample  r egistration  
system  which  provides  reasonable  
estimates   of   demographic   
                                                      
4 Task Force was notified vide MOSPI‘s OM dated 
21.08.2020  
28  indicators   for   the   inter -census   
period.    
 
He further opines that surveys   
carried   out   by   the   National   
Statistical   Office (NSO)   also   
provide   import ant   cross   checks   
on   a   variety   of   statistical 
indicators.   Unfortunately,   in   a   
number   of   cases   the   survey   
data   has   supplanted  the  
administrative  data  as  the  
primary  source  of  statistical  
information.    Although  the  reasons  
are  obvious,  this  is  in  not  a  
particularly  desirable  state  of  
affairs  since  it  pits  the  statistical  
agency  against  the  administrative  
mechanism,  rather  than  the  two  
working  as  partners.  It is also 
much more expen sive.  A more 
sensible system would involve the 
use of limited surveys based on 
strong statistical principles to 
provide  validation  and  corrective  
factors  for  the  data  generated  on  
a  regular  basis  through  
administrative  accounts.    In  an  
important  sense  this  would  be  
akin  to  implementing  a  sample  
audit  system,  where  perhaps the 
purpose would not be to find fault 
but to provide information which  
would  be  used  to  correct  the  
inherent  biases  that  may  occur  in  
adminis trative record keeping. In  
the  final  analysis,  however,  the  
main  factors  governing  the  
usability  of  administrative  data  
for  statistical  purposes  are  the  
legal  framework  underpinning  the  
data  collection  activity  and  the  political   importance attached to the 
government interventions concerned.  
 
11. Institutional Mechanism  
 
The evaluation of administrative 
data quality for statistical purposes 
can be a huge task. One step in this 
evaluation process is – after dealing 
with concepts, cla ssifications, 
timeliness, processing and data 
treatment, data linkage and 
matching and other issues – verify if 
the information that we get from 
administrative data sources is valid 
and precise. Recently, MoSPI has put 
in place a dedicated Division in the 
Ministry to explore the possibilities 
of statistical usages of alternative 
source of data for official statistics. 
Besides, on the recommendations of 
the National Statistical Commission 
(NSC), MOSPI has also constituted a 
Committee5 under the Chairmanship 
of Dr. KiranPandya, Member, NSC  
inter alia  to do the following:  
 
a. Identify availability of possible 
alternative institutional data sources 
in Centre and State in India;  
 
b. Suggesting an institutional 
framework enabling usages of 
alternative data sources in official 
statistics in India;  
 
c. List out the scope and 
coverage of alternative data source(s) 
in Indian context;  
 
                                                      
5 MOSPI Order dated 11.02.2021  
29  d. Lay down guidelines for 
developing survey instruments in 
view of available alternative data 
sources; and  
 
e. Deliberate upon any other  
relevant matter.  
 
12. Conclusion  
 
It is reiterated that the objective of 
the document is to generate 
discussion, and deliberation among 
policy framers, theoriticians and 
practioners and other stakeholders, 
necessitating the need for 
methodological statistic al work on 
administrative data. It is evident 
that s uch data are being used 
increasingly more widely —partly a 
consequence of the ‗big data‘ 
revolution. But drawing any reliable 
inferences from such data encounters 
problems that are d iverse from the 
sociabl e and arterial promenade o f 
sampling theory inference. The 
problems are manifold  and 
contrasting , so it is irresolute  that a n 
integrated  theory , as elegant as that 
of sampling theory , can be developed  
without providing for environment 
for exclusive researc h and 
development in the country . But ,  
nevertheless some fundamental 
propositions are well settled. These 
include the need to stand on one‘s 
two feet regarding data quality 
issues, the identification  that, 
despite peripheral emergence , we 
ordinarily  do no t have ‗all‘ the data, 
possible mismatches between the 
question we want to answer and the information in the available data, 
challenges arising from the fact that 
the data are (usually)  merely 
observational, so elucidation of 
causality is difficult, the ne ed to 
combine data from multiple rather 
different sources, and issues of 
confidentiality, privacy and 
anonymization which might be 
rather different from those of survey 
data.

 Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS)   
Operational Guidelines (OGs)   
 
I. Objective of the Scheme  
Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) aims to mitigate the hardship 
of the insured farmers against the likelihood of financial loss on account of 
anticipated crop loss resulting from adverse weather conditions relating to 
rainfall, temperature, wind,  humidity etc.  WBCIS uses weather parameters as 
“proxy‟ for crop yields in compensating the cultivators for deemed crop losses. 
Payout structures are developed to the extent of losses deemed to have been 
suffered using the weather triggers.  
 
II. Coverage of Farmers  
Refer  para I I of OGs of PMFBY.  
 
III. Coverage of Crops  
1) Food Crops (Cereals,  Millets and Pulses)  
2) Oilseeds  
3) Commercial / Horticultural crops  
 
IV. Weather Perils to be Covered  
1. Following major weather perils, which are deemed to cause “Adverse 
Weather Incidence”, leading to crop loss, shall be covered under the 
scheme :  
a) Rainfall – Deficit Rainfall, Excess rainfall, Unseasonal Rainfall, Rainy 
days, Dry -spell, Dry days  
b) Temperature – High temperature (heat), Low temperature  
c) Relative Humidity  
d) Wind Speed  
e) A combination of the above  
f) Hailstorm, cloud -burst may  also be covered as Add -on/Index -Plus 
products for those farmers who have already taken  normal coverage 
under WBCIS . 
The perils listed above are only indicative and not exhaustive  and any 
addition / delet ion may be considered by State Govt.  in consultation with 
insurance companies based on availability of relevant data.  
2. State Government shall consider to cover such perils which are capable of 
causing  severe &  quantifiable loss and can be induced directly or indirectly 
by change in measurable weather parameters  to capture the losses during 
the adverse climatic conditions and have demonstrated correlation with 
quantifiable yield losses of crop due to such perils . 
3. Only adverse weather incidences which can cause substantial crop losses 
should only be covered, or the triggers identified in such a way that major 
losses are captured. Too conservative triggers tend to lead to frequent 
but smaller payouts, diluting the indemnity principle of insurance.    
4. State Governments will also continue to conduct the requisite number of 
Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in areas where WBCIS is implemented to 
enable the implementing agencies to make analytical study for assessing 
File No: 11019/01/2015 -Credit -II(pt) 
 
3 
 perfo rmance of  the Scheme vis-à-vis  yield Index based crop Insurance 
Schemes (i.e. PMFBY ) and Benchmarking of products.  
5. The specific “Adverse Weather Incidence” with its timing / duration 
applicable to a particular Notified crop shall be notified by the SLCCC I. 
 
 
V. Period of Risk (i.e. Insurance Period)  
Risk period would ideally be from sowing period to maturity of the crop. Risk 
period depending on the duration of the crop and weather parameters chosen, 
could vary with individual crop and reference unit area  and would be notified by 
SLCCCI before the commencement of risk period.  
 
VI. Preconditions for Implementation of the Scheme  
Refer  para V of OGs of PMFBY . 
 
VII.  Notification  
State/UT Government should ensure issuance of the notification and its 
circulation to all concerned agencies / departments / institutions atleast one 
month prior to the commencement of the crop season / risk period. Notification 
issued by State government / UT should  necessarily contain following details:   
a) Crops and Reference Unit Areas notified in various districts.  
b) Applicable Sum Insured, Premium rates, and subsidy  etc. 
c) Term -sheets / product structures of various crops and Reference Unit 
Areas  (RUA )  
d) Seasonality discipline for various activities.  
e) List of Reference and Back -up Weather Stations for each Reference 
Unit Area  
 
VIII. Selection of Areas & Crops  
1. SLCCCI shall, for the purpose of selection of crops under WBCIS, 
consider factors such as availability of historical weather data, minimum 
cropped area, weather perils capable of causing significant & quantifiable 
losses by change in measurable weather parameters  etc.   
2. State Govt. may convene meetings with insurance providers and experts 
of Agro -meteorology / agronomy from State Agriculture Universities, 
Research Institutes etc. for finalization of triggers, term -sheets and pay -
out etc. before SLCCCI meeting. A T echnical Committee may be 
constituted by the State Government for selection of crop(s), area(s), 
weather triggers under WBCIS, examination of proposals received from 
the Insurance Companies, and finalization of term -sheets for the proposed 
crop(s) / area(s ) based on demonstrated correlation with historical weather 
& yield data and further evaluation of products & benefits to the farmers on 
insurance principles.  
3. The Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in selected 
notified RU As. Therefore , State Govt. may notify the smallest possible 
areas as insurance units / RUAs, which should be preferably, the Village 
Panchayat / Revenue Circle / Mandal / Hobli / Block / Tehsil etc.

 IX. Notification of the seasonality discipline  
Refer  para VI(9) & I X of OGs of PMFBY.  
 
X. Notification of Reference Weather Station s (RWS) and Authorized Data 
providers  
1. SLCCCI based on distance and location and availability of Automatic Weather 
Stations / Rain Gauge will approve “Reference Weather Stations (RWS) for 
RUA‟s. In addition to RWS for all RUAs, additional weather stations designated 
as Back -up Weather Stations (BWS) shall be notified for use in case RWS is 
unable to provide data for any reason. Information of RUAs along with RWS 
and back up weather stations shall be covered in notification issued at the 
commencement of the season. Such AWS & ARG should meet the 
requirement s &standards as recommended in report of the committee  
constituted to draft the Guidelines for setting up Automatic Weather Stations 
(AWSs) and Automatic Rain Gauges (ARGs) by private agencies and their 
accreditation, standardization, validation  and quality management of weather 
data etc.  circulated by this Department in 2015.  
2. Any new AWS/ARG including 5000 AWS  planned to  be established under PPP 
mode  with support from Govt. of India , should be set up following the guidelines 
envisaged in the report of the above mentioned committee . 
3. All claims shall be settled based on actual data recorded by the RWS. There is 
no protocol to revise or make change in the actual weather data recorded by the 
Reference AWS (notified) . The insurance companies / their data provider will 
provide daily weather data recorded in the notified AWSs / ARGs to the State 
Govt. on request and they should also be given access to view real time 
weather data of the  notified AWSs / ARGs, if so desired .   
 
XI. Sum Insured  
1. The Sum Insured (SI) for each notified crop is pre -defined and will be  same for 
loanee and non -loanee farmers , which will be  based on the ‘Scale of finance ’ as 
decided by the District Level Technical Committee. If the scale of finance is not 
declared by DLTC the sum insured will be  broadly  based on the c ost of 
cultivation of the crops and will be  decided by State Government. Sum Insured 
for individual farmer is equal to the Sum Insured multiple by acreage of the 
notified crop.  ‘Area under cultivation’  shall always be expressed in ‘hectare’.  
2. The Sum Insured of the crop may be distributed among the critical phases of 
the crop based on the accumulating input costs in its growing path of the crop 
during that phase. However, the sum insured assigned to the subsequent 
phases may be the summation of  its previous phases to provide adequate 
compensation on damage of crop at later stages.  
 
XII.  Premium Rates &  Premium Subsidy  
Refer  para VIII of OGs of PMFBY.  
 
XIII. Participation of Insurance Companies in Implementation of the Scheme  
Refer para XXIII of OGs of PMFBY.  
 
XIV. Collection of Proposals and Premium Amount  
Refer  para X of OGs of PMFBY .

XV.Claims Assessment & Settlement  
1. Insurance company shall be responsible for all claims arising out of adverse 
weather incidence and shall settle claims  strictly as per the terms and 
conditions of the scheme mentioned in the notification. In case of adverse 
weather incidence all the insured cultivators growing the notified crop in a RUA 
shall be deemed to have suffered the same level of  adverse weather co ndition  
& same proportion of crop loss and become eligible for the same rate of claims.  
2. Claims shall be assessed only on the basis of weather data recorded by the 
notified RWSs or BWS, as the case may be, and the claims process shall 
commence once the weat her data is received.  The weather data providers 
should ensure that the exposure conditions of AWS, their standardization / 
calibration, maintenance and weather data transmission meet the guidel ines 
issued by the Government.  
3. Claims processing should be st rictly as per the insurance term sheets, payout 
structure and the Scheme provisions.  Claims shall be worked out as per the 
Insurance Declarations received from the Nodal Branches/ Nodal Banks for 
each notified area and crop.  
4. Administrative structure for c ollection of premium, insurance proposal and 
remittance of admissible claim along with other return will be same as PMFBY. 
(Refer para X of Operational Guidelines of PMFBY)  
5. All standard Claims should be processed and paid within 45 days from the end 
of the  risk period. Further verification &  collection of relevant documents / 
papers, if required, in respect of affected farmers should be completed within a 
period of 30 days from payment of standard claims of season.  
6. Insurance Companies should verify & satis fy themselves about the insured 
farmers, crops & areas before approaching the Government for release of 
Subsidy. Cases of area discrepancies under WBCIS will be settled as per 
procedure explained in para XVII(4) of OGs of PMFBY, and such cases should 
be se ttled within a maximum period of three months  from closing of crop 
season.  
7. Disputed claims / sub -standard claims, if any, shall be referred through State 
Government to DAC &FW  for disposal by the insurance company and the 
decision or any interpretation of D AC&FW  of provisions of scheme or disputes 
shall be binding on all concerned.  
8. If observed index value falls below or above, (as the case may be) the notified 
trigger value, then claims per unit shall be calculated using following formula 
depending upon inde x definition:  
 
Claims per Unit = (Difference between Observed & Notified index      
values) X Notional Payout  
Overall claims will be ‘Claims per Unit’  X  ‘Number of units’

Z  C  200  150  100  50  80  6500  80  
 
RUA X:  In this case notified trigger value is 200. Observed index value is 300. 
In this case there would be no claim payable as the notified trigger is not 
breached.  
RUA Y:  Here observed index value is 120.   
Hence, claims per unit will be: {(200 -150)*50}+{(150 -120)*80} = Rs. 4900.  
For two hectares, overall claim= Rs. 4900 X 2= Rs. 9800/ - 
RUA Z:  Here observed index value is 80 which has breached the exit level. 
Hence in this case the full sum insured assigned to the phase of Rs. 6500 per 
unit would be payable.  
For two hectares, overall claim = Rs. 6500 X 2= Rs. 13000/ - 
Using the methodology discussed above, total claims will be worked out.  
XVI. Modalities for assessment of loss due to localized perils of Hailstorm and 
Cloudburst (Add -on / Index -Plus product)  
Refer all sub -paras of para XV of OGs of PMFBY . 
 
XVII.  Important Conditions / Clauses Applicable for Coverage of Risks  
1. In case of any substantial misreporting by bank branch  / cooperative nodal bank 
/ PACS  particularly of compulsory farmers coverage, the concerned bank only 
shall be liable for such misreporting. Refer para XXIV.4 . ’e’ of sub -head “Lead 
Bank /  Administrative Office of commercial banks /RRBs ” & ‘f’ of sub-head 
“Lending Banks/RFIs ”.  
2. Insured / applicant must have insurable interest. Mere sanctioning / 
disbursement of crop loans and submission of proposals / declarations and 
remittance of premium by farmer/ bank, without explicit intent to raise the crop, 
does not constitute acceptance of risk by insurance company.

organizations / institutions and Independent Third Part ies like N ational 
Collateral Management Services Limited (NCML) , Weather Risk Management 
Services Pvt. Limited ( WRMS ), Skymet etc. should only be notified as 
Reference Weather Stations (RWSs) or Back up Wea ther Stations (BWSs) 
which meet  the basic minimum criteria fixed by the IMD / Government f or the 
purpose.  
b) The data provider should ensure that all the equipments, weather sensors etc. 
of AWSs  / ARGs should be standard, installed properly and regularly 
maintained  as per the specification detailed in  the G uideline s issued by IMD / 
DAC &FW  and the equipments should also be calibrated  regularly.  
c) The data provider should maintain the quality of weather data and standards 
for dissemination, retrieval & validation of weather data etc.  
d) The data provider should work independent from the insurer (insurance  
Company) and insured (farmer).

XIX.   Illustration for preparation of Term sheet  
Crop season is segregated into 3 -4 phases according to important activities 
taking place in growth cycle of the crop (i.e. critical stages).  For example, if 
rainfall period is from 15th June to 31st August. The requirement of rain (water) 
by the crop plant may also vary fortnightly (i.e. 1 -15th July, 15 -31st July, 1 -15th 
August, 16-31st August, 1 -15th September and so on) or monthly or such other 
period that the State Government decides.  Therefore, the requirement of 
rainfalls / weather parameters should be assessed for each fortnight / month 
according to historical data. The pay -out trigger(s) should be fixed strictly 
according to demonstrated correlation with requirement of weather parameters 
to the crop at each critical stages and also soil types, topography etc. Product 
outlines of such product are given below:
